<li>A qualitative study, using focus groups and interviews, to investigate why certain aspects of a person’s economic stability and/or physical environment (e.g. access to green space and well-maintained walkways, etc.) seems to correspond with lower risk of transition from acute to chronic pain in adults with lower back injuries</li>

<p><strong>How this field will be used</strong></p>
<blockquote>

<ul>
<li>A clinician treating pain patients wants to keep up to date on research and development of non-opioid pain drugs and/or non-drug pain treatments.</li>
<li>A pain patient read physical therapy, exercise, and/or electrotherapy may help, and seeks research/evidence on these interventions.</li>
</ul>
