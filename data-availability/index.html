</ul>
<p><strong>Extra context:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A couple of fields in the Data Availability section should be updated throughout a HEAL study’s life-cycle (i.e. fields that ask "Has data collection/production started?" or "Has data release started?" will change from “not started” to “started” to “finished”).</li>
<li>A few fields in the Data Availability section may need to be updated if/as study timelines stray from originally planned timelines (e.g. a study impacted by COVID-related delays may update values initially provided for fields like "Date when first data will be collected/produced" or "Date when first data will be released" if initially planned dates for these milestones are delayed substantially) </li>
<li>To update your study’s metadata <u>after</u> your initial completion of the form, you can always return to the form and change values in a field. The platform will be updated with the new information within about 24 hrs.</li>
</ul>

<details class="note">
<summary>Will the study collect or produce data? Yes/No</summary>
<p><strong>How to answer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Not all HEAL studies collect or produce data. Some develop methods and protocols for future studies. If your study will NOT collect or produce data, but will produce shareable products other than data (e.g. protocols, slide decks, etc.), answer “No.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How this field will be used</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This field allows Platform users to filter between studies that will collect or produce data, and those that will not.</p>
</blockquote>
</details>
<details class="note">
<summary>Will the study make data available? None/Some/All</summary>
<p><strong>How to answer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This field ONLY APPLIES if you answered “Yes” to “Will the study collect or produce data?”</p>
<p>Answers include: </p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>None</em>: If you do not plan to make any study data available in a HEAL approved repository, select “None.” While most HEAL studies are obligated to share data, select HEAL studies, such as SBIR grants, are not.</p>
<p><em>Some</em>: If you plan to make some, but not all, study data available, select “Some.” For example, you may plan to share data needed to reproduce publications, processed data files, or extensively de-identified data, but exclude certain datasets or sources (such as administrative data, when your data sharing agreement does not allow sharing).</p>
<p><em>All</em>: If you plan to make study data available to the greatest extent possible (e.g. sharing nearly raw clinical trial data in a data repository, subject to very strong access controls, including some data that may be very useful for analysis but pose a risk of re-identification, such as highly granular geographic information, detailed diagnostic and care provision, utilization patterns, and/or clinician notes), select “All.”</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How this field will be used</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This field will allow users to filter between studies that will share data, and those that will not. Users who are interested in accessing datasets that include highly sensitive variables that present re-identification risks (e.g. geographic variables with high granularity) may want to filter down to studies that plan to share “All” data, as this will filter out studies that plan to share only extensively de-identified data.</p>
</blockquote>
</details>
<details class="note">
<summary>Will available data have restrictions on access? None/Some/All</summary>
<p><strong>How to answer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This field ONLY APPLIES if you answered “Yes” to “Will the study collect or produce data?” AND you answered “Some” or “All” to “Will the study make data available?”</p>
<p>Answers include</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>None</em>: If all your repository-hosted study data will be open access or minimally restricted (i.e. available after signing a minimal DUA that does not require any manual intervention or approval).</p>
<p><em>Some</em>: If some of your repository-hosted study data will be open access or minimally restricted, while other data will be available only after a request and approval process that does require substantial manual intervention (e.g. submission of a project proposal and IRB approval by the requestor; review by a Data Access Committee on the repository end; etc.). For example, a clinical trial may choose this option when sharing 1) an extensively de-identified dataset that is open access/minimal access controls, AND 2) a less de-identified dataset, shared under strict access controls, that includes features which add value for some analysis questions but also present substantial risk for re-identification.</p>
<p><em>All</em>: If all your repository-hosted study data will be available only following a request and approval process requiring substantial manual intervention (e.g. submission of a project proposal and IRB approval by the requestor; review by a Data Access Committee on the repository end; etc.). For example, a clinical trial may choose this option when ONLY sharing a less de-identified dataset that includes features which add value for some analysis questions, but also present substantial risk for re-identification, shared under strict access controls. These studies WILL NOT share a extensively de-identified version of the data as open access/minimal access controls.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How this field will be used</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This field will allow users looking for data they may be able to access quickly and easily to filter for studies sharing some, or all, of their data as open access/minimal access controls.</p>
</blockquote>
</details>
<details class="note">
<summary>Has data collection/production started? Not started/Started/Finished</summary>
<p><strong>How to answer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This field ONLY APPLIES if you answered “Yes” to “Will the study collect or produce data?”</p>
<p>Answers include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>Not started</em>: If your study, including studies with multiple parts/aims, has not started collecting ANY data.</li>
<li><em>Started</em>: If your study, including studies with multiple parts/aims, started collecting ANY data.</li>
<li><em>Finished</em>: If your study, including studies with multiple parts/aims, finished collecting ALL data.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>This field should be updated as a HEAL study moves through its life-cycle - see <a href="../update-cedar-form-metadata/">information on how to update.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How this field will be used</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This field allows users to filter studies that are at different stages of data collection. Filtering for later stage data collection (e.g. “Started” or “Finished”) helps users find studies that may soon have data available. This field will also allow users more interested in study findings/results than data, to find studies where a publication with findings/results may be  available or expected soon.</p>
</blockquote>
</details>
<details class="note">
<summary>Has data release started? Not started/Started/Finished</summary>
<p><strong>How to answer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This field ONLY APPLIES if you answered “Yes” to “Will the study collect or produce data?” AND you answered “Some” or “All” to “Will the study make data available?”</p>
<p>Answers include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><em>Not started</em>: if your study, including studies with multiple parts/aims, has not started making ANY study data available in a repository for long-term data sharing.</li>
<li><em>Started</em>: if your study, including studies with multiple parts/aims, started making ANY study data available in a repository for long-term data sharing, but is not finished (i.e. will share more data later).</li>
<li><em>Finished</em>: if your study, including studies with multiple parts/aims, finished making ALL study data available in a repository for long-term data sharing (i.e. no further data to share).</li>

<summary>Will the study produce shareable products other than data? Yes/No</summary>
<p><strong>How to answer</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>If your study will produce shareable products other than data (e.g. protocols, slide decks, data dictionaries, etc.), answer “Yes.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>How this field will be used</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Some HEAL studies do “pre-work” for other HEAL studies (e.g. protocol development) and do not collect data. Others (i.e. small business grant studies) are not obligated to share data. This field enables Platform Users 1) looking for non-data materials such as protocols, and/or 2) interested in learning about studies that will not share data (such as small business grant studies), to explore contacting study leads to develop a collaborative relationship that may provide access to the data via a non-public forum. </p>
