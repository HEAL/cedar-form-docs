Select all that apply. Regardless of study type, HEAL studies pertain to understanding more about <strong>human pain or opioid related conditions</strong> and/or related treatments, interventions, or solutions. Which human pain or opioid related condition(s) does your study contribute to understanding? <strong>For example:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A pragmatic clinical trial to treat fibromyalgia pain with a combination of physical therapy and electro physiotherapy, would likely select “Pain," “Pain, chronic," and “Pain, resulting from chronic illness.”</li>
<li>A basic biochemistry study to understand the mechanism of fentanyl binding to opioid receptors in the brain and the resulting signaling triggered systems, might choose “Opioid overdose” and/or “Opioid use and opioid use disorder.”</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>These values will likely be filterable under “Advanced Search” on the HEAL Platform Discovery page, and will allow users to quickly find broad, relevant studies, study data, or study-generated knowledge. <strong>For example:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Opioid Exposure:</em></strong> A pre-K/K school teacher knows their surrounding community has high rates of OUD and wonders if student behavioral issues can be attributed to in utero opioid exposure. They also want to recognize exposure impacts and support intervention for students and their parents.</li>
<li><strong><em>Opioid use and opioid use disorder, relapse; Opioid use and opioid use disorder, chronic:</em></strong> A family member or case manager of a person at high risk of relapse and taking medication for chronic OUD, wants to identify appropriate OUD treatment(s), and learn about geographic and other factors impacting treatment access.</li>
<li><strong><em>Opioid use and opioid use disorder, relapse:</em></strong> A clinician treating OUD notices a high rate of relapse in patients. They seek research on relapse risk factors, or preventive and therapeutic interventions to target OUD relapse.</li>
<li><strong><em>Pain, acute; Pain, resulting from surgery:</em></strong> A patient scheduled for surgery, whose doctor recommends opioids for acute post-surgical pain, does not want to take opioids due to addiction risks or triggering a relapse (if they have a previous OUD) and seeks research on non-drug or non-opioid treatments to address acute post-surgical pain.</li>

<p>For condition studies, what (if any) other causally related conditions is the study measuring, observing, understanding, or otherwise investigating? For treatment studies, what condition and treatment outcomes are being measured? <strong>For example:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A basic science study, using single cell DRG neuron pain stimuli exposures (in cultures), to investigate the timing and mechanistic relationship, at the cellular level, between acute pain signaling and transition to chronic pain signaling signatures (Causal condition: <strong>“pain," “acute pain”</strong>; Target condition: <strong>“pain," “acute pain”</strong>; Outcome condition: <strong>“pain,"“chronic pain”</strong>).</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>NLM MeSH allows you to be general (e.g. “chronic disease," “multiple chronic conditions”) and/or specific (e.g. “end stage liver disease," “osteoarthritis, knee”). Use this range of specificity to add all applicable terms.</p>

<p><strong>How this field will be used</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>The values from this field will likely be available either as 1) an "Advanced Search" filter on the HEAL Platform Discovery page (depending on the range of answers across HEAL studies we get for this field, a simple filter may not be useful if the list is too long; we may be able to implement an auto-complete feature that would make a long filter list tenable and retain utility), to will allow Platform users to quickly filter down to the broad type of study, study data, or study-generated knowledge in which they are most interested, and/or as 2) accessible to free text search and discovery tools that leverage elastic and semantic search to make it possible for Platform users to find your study based on the exact term you selected, or a close/related match to that term. <strong>Examples include:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>I'm a clinician who treats fibromyalgia patients and want to find research/data that may point to ways to better address fibromyalgia-associated pain, especially with the goal of increasing the functional status of my patients (filter on Causal condition: <strong>"fibromyalgia"</strong>; Target condition: <strong>"pain", "chronic pain"</strong>; Outcome condition: <strong>"physical function"</strong>)</li>
<li>I'm a clinician who treats fibromyalgia patients and want to find research/data that may point to ways to better address/treat the underlying disease to make development of fibromyalgia-associated pain less likely or severe (filter on Causal condition: <strong>"fibromyalgia"</strong>; Target condition: <strong>"fibromyalgia"</strong>; Outcome condition: <strong>"pain", "chronic pain"</strong>)</li>
<li>I'm a patient with end stage renal disease and a lot of associated pain - I want to see what research is going on to develop treatments for pain in ESRD patients, to reduce pain and pain-associated sleep deprivation (filter on Causal condition: "end stage renal disease" or <strong>"chronic kidney disease"</strong>; Target condition: <strong>"pain", "chronic pain"</strong>; Outcome condition: <strong>"pain"</strong>, <strong>"chronic pain"</strong>, <strong>"sleep deprivation"</strong>)</li>
<li>I'm a mayor of a town with crisis rates of deaths from opioid overdose and I want to look for interventions that will reduce these immediate catastrophic harms in my town as soon as possible (filter on Causal condition: Not applicable (non-pain condition focus); Target condition: <strong>"opiate overdose"</strong>; Outcome condition: <strong>"death"</strong>)</li>

<p>This field is an array. The controlled vocabulary/pick-list is the NLM MeSH (National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings – see the tree view of this vocabulary <a href="https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/treeView">here</a>), which covers a wide-ranging set of terms over many health-related categories including <strong>Diseases/Health Conditions</strong> (containing most terms you will need for this field). When you first click into this field, you may see an “odd” value, belonging to a category of NLM MeSH that does not apply to this field. Ignore that. Start typing the health condition of interest, and the drop down list will populate with items based on your inputs.</p>
<p>For condition studies, what (if any) other causally related conditions is the study measuring, observing, understanding, or otherwise investigating? For treatment studies, what condition and treatment outcomes are being measured? <strong>For example:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A trial to determine efficacy of modifying ESRD dialysis regimens to reduce pain and mortality, while collecting self-reported baseline (and other) depression and anxiety metrics (Causal condition: “end stage renal disease”; Target condition: end stage renal disease; Outcome condition: <strong>“pain,"“death”</strong>; Other condition: <strong>“depression,"“anxiety," “mental health”</strong>)</li>
<li>A basic science study, using single cell DRG neuron pain stimuli exposures (in cultures), to investigate the timing and mechanistic relationship, at the cellular level, between acute pain signaling and transition to chronic pain signaling signatures, while also measuring neuron inflammatory molecule/ cytokine production status (Causal condition: <strong>“pain," “acute pain”</strong>; Target condition: <strong>“pain," “acute pain”</strong>; Outcome condition: <strong>“pain,"“chronic pain”</strong>; Other condition: <strong>“inflammation,"“neurogenic inflammation”</strong>).</li>
</ul>

<p>The values from this field will likely be available as 1) an “Advanced Search” filter on the HEAL Platform Discovery page (depending on the range of answers, a simple filter may not be useful, but we may implement an auto-complete to make a long filter list tenable and retain utility), allowing users to quickly filter to broad, relevant studies, study data, or study-generated knowledge, and/or 2) accessible to free text search and discovery tools that leverage elastic and semantic search, so users can find your study with exact or close/related terms. For <strong>example:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>A researcher hypothesizing a link between anxiety and conversion to chronic pain seeks studies following cohorts of acute pain patients over time that also track conversion to chronic pain and measure anxiety (Causal condition: <strong>“pain," “acute pain”</strong>; Target condition: <strong>“pain," “acute pain”</strong>; Outcome condition: <strong>“pain,"“chronic pain”</strong>; Other condition: <strong>“anxiety”</strong>)</li>
