# Minimal Info

[Expand](expand-or-collapse-cedar-form-section.md) the Minimal Info section. This section has four fields:

>>  1. Study Title or Name 
>>  2. Study Description or Abstract 
>>  3. Alternative Study Title or Name 
>>  4. Alternative Study Description or Abstract

## Study Title or Name and Study Description or Abstract

The “Study Title or Name” and “Study Description or Abstract” auto-populate from NIH RePORTER. Ensure your study title and description are correct.

 * **If one or both are incorrect, contact heal-support@datacommons.io immediately, and do NOT fill out the form until instructed to. Do NOT edit pre-populated fields. They will NOT save.**

## Alternative Study Title or Name and Alternative Study Description or Abstract

You are not required to provide an alternative study title and/or description, as the original study title and description will appear on the Platform, regardless of these alternative values. However, there are good reasons to provide them:

 * The text is searchable via the Platform’s free-text search and discovery tools, so key terms and/or alternative study name structures (including study name acronyms) may make your study more findable.
 * The text may be visible on the Platform’s study page in the future, allowing users to read it and better determine whether your study is of interest.

Once complete, [collapse](expand-or-collapse-cedar-form-section.md) the Minimal Info section and [save](save-cedar-form.md) your form.
