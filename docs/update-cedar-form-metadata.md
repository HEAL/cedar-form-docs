!!! note
**The Platform will provide access to a re-visitable portal on the Platform that will allow investigators to update metadata fields that will/may need to be updated as a HEAL study moves through its life-cycle. <mark>If you need to update metadata fields from the CEDAR form before this portal is available, please reach out to the Platform Help Desk at heal-support@datacommons.io for assistance.</mark>**
