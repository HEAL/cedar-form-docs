# How to Identify and Complete CEDAR Array Type Fields

!!! note "How to identify an array type field"
    When you click into a field, you will see a “1,2,3” list toggle icon to the left of the “?” icon (upper right corner of the gray field area); if you mouse over this icon, it will say “Toggle View.”

!!! note "How to Complete an Arry Type Field"
    An array field accepts multiple values. See instructions to provide one or multiple values in a CEDAR array field below.

***

* For an array type field, if you have only one value to enter, click the field and enter the value by typing or pasting the value. Click “OK” to submit this.
* If you have **more than one value**:
    * Click the field.
    * Click the “1,2,3 list” toggle to the left of the “?” icon in the upper right corner (if you mouse over this icon it will say “Toggle View”).
    * A spreadsheet interface will pop out.
    * Double click and enter a value in each row until you are done.
    * When you are done, click the “Toggle View” icon again (same location, but now looks like two small, solid triangles pointing away from each other).
    * The spreadsheet will collapse and expose an “OK” button.
    * Click “OK” to submit your values and exit the field.
