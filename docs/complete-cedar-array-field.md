# How to Identify and Complete CEDAR Array Type Fields

!!! note
**How to Identify an Array Type Field:** When you click into a field, you will see a “1,2,3 list” toggle view icon just to the left of the “?” icon in the upper right corner of the gray field area (if you mouse over this icon it will say “Toggle View”). 

!!! note
**How to Complete an Arry Type Field:** An array type field accepts multiple values. See instructions below to provide values (one or multiple) in a CEDAR array type field. 

***

* For an array type field, if you have **only one value** to enter, click into the field and enter the value by typing or copy/pasting the value in. Click the “OK” button to submit this value. 
* If you have **more than one value** to enter:
    * click into the field, 
    * click on the “1,2,3 list” toggle view icon just to the left of the “?” icon in the upper right corner of the gray field area (if you mouse over this icon it will say “Toggle View”). 
    * this will pop out a spreadsheet type interface. 
    * enter a new value in each row of the spreadsheet interface by double clicking into the row and typing or copy/pasting the value 
    * when you are done entering values, click the “Toggle View” icon again (the icon is in the same spot as the first time you clicked it, but now looks like two small filled-in triangles pointing outward from each other) 
    * this will collapse the spreadsheet view and expose the “OK” button 
    * click the "OK" button to submit the values and exit the field
