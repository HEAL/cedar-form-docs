**Extra context:**

* Most of the fields in this section will apply to your study <u>even if your study is not a human subjects study</u> 
* The fields in this section will provide metadata that will allow Platform Users to filter to 

??? note "[Exclusive] Find studies that will have *clear special applicability* to human populations with specific demographic characteristics that are of interest to the Platform User"
    **Example**

    > A Platform User wants to find studies that specifically study treatment of pain in women, or prevention of opioid use disorder in adolescents - 
    > Results could respectively include:
    
    >>* a basic science trial studying the differential impact of an opioid drug on pain/nociception signaling pathways in the presence versus absence of estrogen, and 
    * a school-based cluster randomized control trial in high schools testing impact of a combination opioid use disorder education curriculum and peer counseling intervention on opioid use disorder incidence)
    
<!-- <div align="center">OR</div> -->

??? note "[Inclusive] Find studies that *may apply* to human populations with specific demographic characteristics that are of interest to the Platform User because they are conducted either without regard to specific demographic characteristics or are conducted in a manner that is inclusive of the full range of a specific demographic characteristic"
    **Example**
    
    > Here the Platform User from the [Exclusive] condition above could broaden their search to find studies that are not super specific to their population of interest but still may have applicable findings and insights; 
    > the Platform User may take this approach if, for example, a more specific [Exclusive] search yields few results - 
    > results could respectively include:
    
    >>* a basic science trial studying the impact of an opioid drug on pain/nociception signaling pathways in a mouse model of lower back injury where both male and female mice are included in the experiments, and 
    * a community-based cluster randomized control trial testing impact of a community-wide postering/flyering communications campaign intervention on opioid use disorder incidence)    
* If your study has **clear special applicability** with respect to a specific demographic characteristic (e.g. biological sex, gender or sexual identity, age), mark all value options within that characteristic category field for which your study has clear special applicability
* If your study **may apply** with respect to a specific demographic characteristic (e.g. biological sex, gender or sexual identity, age) because it is conducted either without regard to that specific demographic characteristics or is conducted in a manner that is inclusive of the full range of that specific demographic characteristic, skip that characteristic category field (mark NONE)

    > This field allows multiple answer selections from a response set, including: Female, Female-to-male transexual, Intersexed, Male, Male-to-female transexual, Other 
    
    > If your study has **clear special applicability** to humans of a specific gender identity or identities, <u>mark all that apply</u>
    
    > Examples of studies with **clear special applicability**:
    >> * a basic science study using biochemstry experiments to investigate potential molecular interactions between puberty-blocking drugs and opioid receptor pathways, and using animal model experiments to investigate the impact of co-administration of puberty-blocking drugs and opioids in an adolescent mouse injury pain model on opioid-induced pain-relief and on risk of opioid addiction &rarr; **this study may choose "Female-to-male transexual", "Male-to-female transexual", and "Other"** (puberty blockers can be prescribed to early-adolescents who consider their gender identity to be trans OR non-binary; non-binary would be covered under the "Other" category)    
    * a clinical trial investigating the efficacy of adding a physical therapy and swim exercise therapy regimen to short-course opioids to prevent transition of acute post-surgical pain to chronic pain in cisgender women and transgender men following surgical mastectomy &rarr; **this study may choose "Female" and "Female-to-male transexual"** 

    
    > If your study **may apply** to humans of a specific gender identity or identities because it is conducted either without regard to gender identity or is conducted in a manner that is inclusive of the full range of gender identities, <u>mark NONE</u>

    > Examples of studies that **may apply**:
    >> * a basic science study using biochemstry experiments to investigate potential molecular interactions between a novel non-opioid analgesic drug and opioid receptor pathways, and using animal model experiments to investigate the impact of co-administration of the novel non-opioid analgesic drug and opioids in an adolescent mouse injury pain model on overall pain-relief and on risk of opioid addiction &rarr; **this study should skip this field, choosing none of the available options** 
    * a clinical trial investigating the efficacy of adding a physical therapy and swim exercise therapy regimen to short-course opioids to prevent transition of acute post-surgical pain to chronic pain in older adults following hip replacement surgery &rarr; **this study should skip this field, choosing none of the available options**
