        This field allows selection of a multiple answers from a limited set of possible answers. See the [definition of this field](https://github.com/HEAL/heal-metadata-schemas/blob/main/for-investigators-how-to/study-level-metadata-fields/study-metadata-schema-for-humans.md#:~:text=condition_category) in the full metadata model for a list of all allowed answer values. Please select all that apply. <u>Please consider:</u> For the majority of HEAL researcher whether conducting a basic science study, clinical trial, implementation or epidemiologic study, the study will pertain somehow to understanding more about a **human pain or opioid related condition** and/or treatments, interventions, or solutions addressing a **human pain or opioid related condition**. Which human pain or opioid related condition(s) does your study contribute to understanding? Examples include: e.g. If I am doing a pragmatic clinical trial to treat fibromyalgia pain with a combination of physical therapy and electrophysiotherapy, I would likely select "Pain", "Pain, chronic", and "Pain, resulting from chronic illness" here; If I am doing a basic biochemistry study to understand the mechanism of binding of fentanyl to opioid receptors in the brain and signaling systems triggered as a result of this binding, I might choose "Opioid overdose" and/or "Opioid use and opioid use disorder"

        The values from this field will likely be available as an "Advanced Search" filter on the HEAL Platform Discovery page, and will allow Platform users to quickly filter down to the broad type of study, study data, or study-generated knowledge in which they are most interested. **Examples include:** 
        <ul>
        <li> I'm a pre-K/K school teacher and I know that the community around my school has high rates of OUD - I wonder if some of the behavioral issues my students have can be attributed to affects of in utero exposure to opioids and if so, how I can recognize these exposure impacts and potentially provide support and intervention to my students and their parents (filter on **"Opioid exposure"**)  
        </li>
        <li>  I'm a family member of or case manager for a person taking medication for chronic OUD who is also at high risk of relapse and I want to identify appropriate OUD treatment(s), and learn about geographic and other factors that may impact my family member or client's ability to access these treatments (filter on **"Opioid use and opioid use disorder, relapse"**, **"Opioid use and opioid use disorder, chronic"**)
        </li>
        <li> I'm a clinician treating OUD patients and I notice that there's a high rate of relapse among my patients - I want to see if there's any research on risk factors for relapse, or on preventive or therapeutic interventions that specifically target relapse of OUD (filter on **"Opioid use and opioid use disorder, relapse"**)
        </li>
        <li> I'm a patient scheduled for surgery, and my doctor has told me I'll need to take opioids for acute post-surgical pain - I don't want to take opioids because I'm worried about becoming addicted to opioids, or in the case of someone with a history of OUD, triggering a relapse and I want to see if there's any research on non-drug, or non-opioid drug treatments to address acute post-surgical pain (filter on **"Pain, acute"**, **"Pain, resulting from surgery"**)

        </li>
        <li> **Public attitudes towards or perception of a condition:** A national survey asking about whether people would feel good about employing someone with OUD, have that person as a friend, having that person marry into the family, using public funding to provide them with long term medical and social support treatment; A study testing efficacy of a community-based communications and education campaign to increase rate at which persons in the community with a history of OUD are able to obtain employment    
        </li>
        <li> **Treatment of a condition:** A study investigating whether providing housing and job training support to people leaving jail on an opioid use or possession charge prevents relapse of OUD or further involvement in the criminal justice system; A phase 3 clinical trial study investigating the efficacy of a novel non-opioid drug to treat chronic pain; A study investigating whether a novel implanted device to provide long-term and slow release of an established MAT drug for OUD can prevent OUD relapse

A study investigating mechanism of or risk for disabling chronic pain in fibromyalgia patients would select the condition "fibromyalgia"; A study measuring incidence and intensity of pain following back surgery would select "surgery" and/or "failed back surgery syndrome".
