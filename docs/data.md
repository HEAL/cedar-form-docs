Please select all that apply. <u>Please consider:</u> If your study will collect quantitative data (e.g. blood pressure reading, self-reported pain on a validated tool scale, community rate of opioid overdose, quantification of number and intensity of DRG nerve action potentials following pain stimulus), please select "Quantitative". If your study will collect qualitative data (e.g. structured notes from and/or coding of focus groups or interviews, medical provider chart notes), please select "Qualitative". If your study will collect both, please select both.

        <ul>
        <li> I'm a pre-K/K school teacher and I know that the community around my school has high rates of OUD - I wonder if some of the behavioral issues my students have can be attributed to affects of in utero exposure to opioids and if so, how I can recognize these exposure impacts and potentially provide support and intervention to my students and their parents - I'm particularly interested in seeing if there are any <u>narrative case studies</u> authored by either medical or educational providers that describe interactions with and behaviors of young children impacted by in utero exposure to OUD to see if they seem similar to my own experiences (filter on **"Qualitative"**)  
        </li>
        <li> I'm a clinician treating OUD patients and I notice that there's a high rate of relapse among my patients - I've seen some news stories and case studies that seem to point towards a potential role for anxiety and depression as risk factors for OUD relapse, and  want to see if there's any research that has collected some quantitative data that could give a better sense for whether anxiety and depression are clearly significant risk factors, and if so, whether these factors increase relapse risk by a clinically meaningful amount (filter on **"Quantitative"**)

        <li> **Public attitudes towards or perception of a condition:** A national survey asking about whether people would feel good about employing someone with OUD, have that person as a friend, having that person marry into the family, using public funding to provide them with long term medical and social support treatment; A study testing efficacy of a community-based communications and education campaign to increase rate at which persons in the community with a history of OUD are able to obtain employment    
        </li>
        <li> **Treatment of a condition:** A study investigating whether providing housing and job training support to people leaving jail on an opioid use or possession charge prevents relapse of OUD or further involvement in the criminal justice system; A phase 3 clinical trial study investigating the efficacy of a novel non-opioid drug to treat chronic pain; A study investigating whether a novel implanted device to provide long-term and slow release of an established MAT drug for OUD can prevent OUD relapse

The controlled vocabulary/pick-list used for this field is the <u>NLM MeSH</u> (National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings – see the tree view of this vocabulary [here](https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/treeView)), which is a wide-ranging set of terms inclusive of many health-related term categories including, but not limited to, **Diseases/Health Conditions** (these are the terms that we generally expect folks to make use of for this field). <u>When you first click into this field, you may see some "odd" looking values</u> that belong to a category of the NLM MeSH that does not apply well to this field.  If you <u>start typing in the health condition you are looking for </u> (e.g. start typing in the first letters of the health condition "fibromyalgia"), the drop down list will populate with items that start with the typed in letters and you should be able to find your condition of interest. <u>Please consider:</u> For condition-focused studies, what (if any) is a condition also being measured or observed as part of the study that may be causally downstream from the target condition the study is focused on observing, understanding, or otherwise investigating; For studies focused on treatment of a condition, what is the condition that is being measured as the outcome following treatment of the target condition in your study. Examples include: A study that conducts a trial to determine efficacy of modifications to the dialysis regimen of ESRD patients to reduce pain and mortality that also collects self-reported depression and anxiety metrics at baseline and other study timepoints (<i>Causal condition:</i> **"end stage renal disease"**; <i>Target condition:</i> **end stage renal disease**; <i>Outcome condition:</i> **"pain"**,**"death"**; <i>Other condition:</i> **"depression"**,**"anxiety"**, **"mental health"**); A basic science study using single cell pain stimuli exposures of DRG neurons in culture to investigate the timing of and mechanistic relationship at the cellular level between acute pain signalling and transition to chronic pain signalling signatures, that also measures status of inflammatory molecule/cytokine production by these neurons (<i>Causal condition:</i> **"pain"**, **"acute pain"**; <i>Target condition:</i> **"pain"**, **"acute pain"**; <i>Outcome condition:</i> **"pain"**,**"chronic pain"**; <i>Other condition:</i> **"inflammation"**,**"neurogenic inflammation"**). NLM MeSH allows you to be quite general (e.g. "chronic disease", "multiple chronic conditions") and/or quite specific (e.g. "end stage liver disease", "osteoarthritis, knee"). Please feel free to add as many terms as apply to add as much color on both ends of the specificity spectrum as makes sense for your study.

    <details><summary>**How this field will be used**</summary><blockquote>
        The values from this field will likely be available either as 1) an "Advanced Search" filter on the HEAL Platform Discovery page (depending on the range of answers across HEAL studies we get for this field, a simple filter may not be useful if the list is too long; we may be able to implement an auto-complete feature that would make a long filter list tenable and retain utility), to will allow Platform users to quickly filter down to the broad type of study, study data, or study-generated knowledge in which they are most interested, and/or as 2) accessible to free text search and discovery tools that leverage elastic and semantic search to make it possible for Platform users to find your study based on the exact term you selected, or a close/related match to that term. **Examples include:** 
        <ul>
        <li> I'm a researcher with a hypothesis about a link between anxiety and conversion of acute to chronic pain - I want to look for studies following cohorts of acute pain patients over time that also track conversion to chronic pain and measure anxiety status (<i>Causal condition:</i> **"pain"**, **"acute pain"**; <i>Target condition:</i> **"pain"**, **"acute pain"**; <i>Outcome condition:</i> **"pain"**,**"chronic pain"**; <i>Other condition:</i> **"anxiety"**)
