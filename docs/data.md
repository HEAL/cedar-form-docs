        </li>
        <li> I'm a clinician treating OUD patients and I notice that there's a high rate of relapse among my patients - I've seen some news stories and case studies that seem to point towards a potential role for anxiety and depression as risk factors for OUD relapse, and  want to see if there's any research that has collected some quantitative data that could give a better sense for whether anxiety and depression are clearly significant risk factors, and if so, whether these factors increase relapse risk by a clinically meaningful amount (filter on **"Quantitative"**)

This field allows selection of multiple answers from a limited set of possible answers. See the [definition of this field](https://github.com/HEAL/heal-metadata-schemas/blob/main/for-investigators-how-to/study-level-metadata-fields/study-metadata-schema-for-humans.md#:~:text=subject_geographic_data_level_available) in the full metadata model for a list of all allowed answer values. Please select all that apply. <u>Please consider:</u> For studies with human subjects that collect geographic data and will make at least some data available, will geographic data be made available? if so, what level of geographic detail will be made available? E.g. If your study will collect exact address information for enrolled individuals but will only make zip code level geographic data available in data sets depoosited in a public repository, please select "Zip code"; If your study will collect zip code information for enrolled individuals and will make two distict data sets available in a public repository, a restricted-acces dataset with zip code information, and an open-access dataset with zip code information coded up to the state-level, please select both "Zip code" and "State"; etc.

    <details><summary>**How this field will be used**</summary><blockquote>
        The values from this field will likely be available as an "Advanced Search" filter on the HEAL Platform Discovery page, and will allow Platform users to quickly filter down to the broad type of study, study data, or study-generated knowledge in which they are most interested. They will also be browsable text on the study page of studies indexed on the HEAL Platform so that Platform users that find a study can easily access this information by viewing the study page. **Examples include:** 
        <ul>
        <li> I'm a researcher looking for studies for a meta-analysis of studies that have looked at the impact of housing insecurity on OUD outcomes following completion of residential OUD treatment program, and I want to limit the studies in my meta-analysis to those that collected indidividual level data, including high-resolution geographic data for individuals, because I want to combine individual level data for my meta-analysis and I want to correct for individual-level socio-enviornmental factors that can be gleaned from high-resolution geographic data in my analysis - I need geographic data at least as specific as census tract, and I only want to include data that is already available in a public data repository (filter on **"Exact location"**, **"Census block"**, or **"Census tract"** for both geographic data collected AND geographic data available, or just for geographic data available field)
        </li>
