Please select all that apply. <u>Please consider:</u> If your study will collect quantitative data (e.g. blood pressure reading, self-reported pain on a validated tool scale, community rate of opioid overdose, quantification of number and intensity of DRG nerve action potentials following pain stimulus), please select "Quantitative". If your study will collect qualitative data (e.g. structured notes from and/or coding of focus groups or interviews, medical provider chart notes), please select "Qualitative". If your study will collect both, please select both.

        <ul>
        <li> I'm a pre-K/K school teacher and I know that the community around my school has high rates of OUD - I wonder if some of the behavioral issues my students have can be attributed to affects of in utero exposure to opioids and if so, how I can recognize these exposure impacts and potentially provide support and intervention to my students and their parents - I'm particularly interested in seeing if there are any <u>narrative case studies</u> authored by either medical or educational providers that describe interactions with and behaviors of young children impacted by in utero exposure to OUD to see if they seem similar to my own experiences (filter on **"Qualitative"**)  
        </li>
        <li> I'm a clinician treating OUD patients and I notice that there's a high rate of relapse among my patients - I've seen some news stories and case studies that seem to point towards a potential role for anxiety and depression as risk factors for OUD relapse, and  want to see if there's any research that has collected some quantitative data that could give a better sense for whether anxiety and depression are clearly significant risk factors, and if so, whether these factors increase relapse risk by a clinically meaningful amount (filter on **"Quantitative"**)
