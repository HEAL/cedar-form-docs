# Saving your CEDAR form

!!! note
    As you move through this form, save your entries by scrolling to the bottom of your form and clicking “Save” (**green box at bottom right**). Save often while completing the form so you do not lose any entered metadata. Save each time you complete a form section (or more often).

!!! note
    Saving will not close the page or redirect you.
