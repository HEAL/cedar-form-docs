??? note "Category or Type/Stage of Study Research"
    **How to answer**
    > This field allows multiple answer selections. Select all that apply. Possible answers include:

    >> * Pre-Research/Protocol Development
    * Basic Research
    * Pre-Clinical Research
    * Clinical Research
    * Implementation Research
    * Post-market Research
    * Business Development
    * Epidemiologic Research.

    > If these do not apply, skip the question, or contact heal-support@datacommons.io for questions or support.

    **How this field will be used**
    > These values will likely be filterable under “Advanced Search” on the HEAL Platform Discovery page, and will allow users to quickly find broad, relevant studies, study data, or study-generated knowledge. **For example:**

    >> * *Clinical Research*: A pain patient may seek novel treatments currently at the clinical trial stage.
    * *Post-market Research*: An OUD patient on an MOUD, who is experiencing unexpected side-effects, may look for study information on efficacy and side effects of their drug “in the real world.”
    * *Implementation Research*: A clinician or health system may search for best practices to implement a promising new treatment or clinical process for their pain patients.

??? note "Is the study conducting primary or secondary research?"
    **How to answer**
    > This field allows a single answer selection of “Primary Research” or “Secondary Research.”

    >> * *Primary Research*: Your study will collect primary data (i.e. measurements to generate data to address the study research question) OR conduct an active experiment.
    * *Secondary Research*: Your study will NOT collect primary data AND your study will NOT conduct an active experiment. If these do not apply, skip the question, or contact heal-support@datacommons.io for questions or support.
    
    **How this field will be used**
    > These values will likely be filterable under “Advanced Search” on the HEAL Platform Discovery page, and will allow Platform users to quickly find broad, relevant studies, study data, or study-generated knowledge. **For example:**

    >> * *Primary Research*: A researcher requiring primary research data or results to leverage for a secondary research study, such as a meta-analysis or natural experiment
    * *Secondary Research*: A journalist seeking secondary research examples, enabled by the HEAL Initiative/HEAL Platform, for a story on data re-use and collaborative science making a difference for individuals and communities impacted by OUD and pain conditions.

??? note "Is the study conducting observational or experimental research?"
    **How to answer**
    > This field allows a single answer: “Observational Research” or “Experimental Research.”

    >> * *Observational Research*: If your study will NOT conduct an active experiment (e.g. actively or passively collecting measurements without any intervention, or in the context of a naturally occurring intervention - a “natural experiment”), select “Observational Research."
    * *Experimental Research*: If your study will conduct an active experiment, select “Experimental Research." If these do not apply, skip the question, or contact heal-support@datacommons.io for questions or support.
    
    > If these do not apply, skip the question, or contact heal-support@datacommons.io for questions or support. 

    **How this field will be used**
    > These values will likely be filterable under “Advanced Search” on the HEAL Platform Discovery page, and will allow users to quickly locate broad, relevant studies, study data, or study-generated knowledge.

??? note "Study Subject Type"
    **How to answer**
    > This field allows multiple answer selections from a response set, including:

    >>
    * Human
    * Animal
    * Human cell/tissue/tissue model
    * Animal cell/tissue/tissue model
    * Molecule

    > Select all that apply. **For example:**

    >> * *Human studies* treat or observe individuals or communities of human subjects (e.g. a clinical trial, cross sectional survey, prospective cohort study, clinical process implementation trial, community-based cluster randomized control trial, etc.).
    * *Animal studies* treat or observe animals or animal models (e.g. mice, zebrafish, drosophila).
    * *Human cell/tissue/tissue model OR Animal cell/tissue/tissue model* studies treat or observe human or animal cells (primary or cultured).
    * Molecule studies treat or observe molecules (e.g. enzymology, chemical/protein binding or engineering, protein crystallization, etc.).
    * For *computational studies*, consider your subject of interest (e.g. modeling humans, human interaction, molecules, or molecular interactions). If these do not apply, skip the question, or contact heal-support@datacommons.io for questions or support.
    
    > If these do not apply, skip the question, or contact heal-support@datacommons.io for questions or support. 

    **How this field will be used**
    > These values will likely be filterable under “Advanced Search'' on the HEAL Platform Discovery page, and will allow users to quickly find broad, relevant studies, study data, or study-generated knowledge. For **example:**

    >> * *Animal*: A researcher studying mice to investigate mechanisms of a novel OUD relapse drug treatments, seeks analogous studies in other model organisms.
    * *Animal and Human cell/tissue/tissue model*: A researcher developing a first stage I clinical trial for a novel chronic pain treatment drug, wants to collate all drug research and data (animal studies and in vitro studies in human cells) to decide on a dosing schedule and assays to test efficacy and safety.
    * *Molecule*: A researcher who has unearthed a potential new druggable molecular target to treat acute opioid overdose, wants to know if anyone else has studied the enzymology, crystal structure, etc. of this target.
