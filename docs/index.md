# I found my CEDAR form. Now What?

## Providing team members access to a CEDAR form:

* One individual registers a study on the Platform, but multiple team members can collaborate on a form. 
* Each team member needs a CEDAR account.
* The registering member shares the study’s CEDAR form with other team members.


## Expanding and collapsing form sections:

* CEDAR forms open in “expanded” format, with all metadata fields visible.
* Section headings are in green text, and metadata fields are in black.
* Consider “collapsing” each section and expanding them individually, as needed.


## Overview:

* The CEDAR form has 9 sections: 
    * [Minimal Info](minimal-info.md) 
    * [(Meta)data Location](meta-data-location.md) 
    * [Data Availability](data-availability.md)
    * [Study Translational Focus](study-translational-focus.md) 
    * [Study Type](study-type.md) 
    * [Human Treatment Applicability](human-treatment-applicability.md) 
    * [Human Condition Applicability](human-condition-applicability.md) 
    * Human Subject Applicability
    * [Data](data.md) 

## Best practices:

* Save often to ensure you do not lose any entered metadata.
    * To save, click “Save” on the bottom right of the form. Note that saving will not close the page or redirect you.
* Complete all applicable sections of the form. 
    * If your study does not investigate treatment for a human pain or opioid use condition, skip the “Human Treatment Applicability” section.
    * Some CEDAR form sections may depend on the life-cycle of your HEAL award. Complete the form over time, as the award advances.
* For questions or support, contact heal-support@datacommons.io. We are happy to help!
