# I found my CEDAR form. Now What?

* When you open your CEDAR form, it will be in "expanded" format, with all metadata fields from all form sections visible. 
* The headings of each form section are in green type, while the field name text for each metadata field within a form section is in black type.
* It may be helpful to start by ‘collapsing’ all the form sections down so that you see just the form section headings. This format allows you to see a simple overview of all the form sections, and you can expand one form section at a time as you work on each section in order.
* The CEDAR form has 9 sections: 
    * [Minimal Info](minimal-info.md) 
    * Metadata Location 
    * Data Availability
    * Study Translational Focus 
    * Study Type 
    *Human Treatment Applicability 
    *Human Condition Applicability 
    * Human Subject Applicability
    * Data 
* Start by collapsing all of these sections down so that all you see is the (green text) heading for each of these form sections.
* As you move through this form, save the metadata values you enter by scrolling to the bottom of your form and clicking the “Save” button at the bottom right. 
* **Save often while you are completing the form to ensure that you do not lose any entered metadata values!** A good rule of thumb may be to save each time you complete a form section (or more often!).
* Please complete all sections of the form!

!!! note
**You can collapse a form section by clicking on the form section heading (in green type). Click on the form section heading again to re-expand the form section.** 
   
!!! note
**Help text for each field is available once you click into the field. Once you click into a field, a “?” icon is available in the upper right of the field area. Mouse over the “?” icon to expose help text for that field.**
