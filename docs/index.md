# I found my CEDAR form. Now What?

## Providing team members access to a CEDAR form

* One individual registers a study on the Platform, but multiple team members can collaborate on a form. 
* Each team member needs a CEDAR account.
    * To create an account, visit [https://cedar.metadatacenter.org](https://cedar.metadatacenter.org).
    * Click “Register” below the Password line.
    * In the next window, enter your first name, last name, a functional email address, and a password.
* The registering member shares the study’s CEDAR form with other team members.
    * Click on the vertical three-dots to the right of the CEDAR Form in the CEDAR workspace and select "Share."

## Expanding and collapsing form sections

* CEDAR forms open in “expanded” format, with all metadata fields visible.
* Section headings are in green text, and metadata fields are in black.
* Consider “collapsing” each section and expanding them individually, as needed.


## Overview

* The CEDAR form has 9 sections: 
    * [Minimal Info](minimal-info.md) 
    * [(Meta)data Location](meta-data-location.md) 
    * [Data Availability](data-availability.md)
    * [Study Translational Focus](study-translational-focus.md) 
    * [Study Type](study-type.md) 
    * [Human Treatment Applicability](human-treatment-applicability.md) 
    * [Human Condition Applicability](human-condition-applicability.md) 
    * Human Subject Applicability
    * [Data](data.md) 

## Best practices

* **Save often to ensure you do not lose any entered metadata.**
    * To save, click “Save” on the bottom right of the form. Note that saving will not close the page or redirect you.
* **Complete all applicable sections of the form.** 
    * *If your study does not investigate treatment for a human pain or opioid use condition, skip the “Human Treatment Applicability” section.*
    * Some CEDAR form sections may depend on the life-cycle of your HEAL award. Complete the form over time, as the award advances.
* For questions or support, contact **heal-support@datacommons.io.** We are happy to help!

    **Collapse sections by clicking the section heading (green). Click the section heading again to expand it.**
   
!!! note
    **Help text is available. Once you enter a field, mouse over the “?” icon in the upper right to view help text for that field.**

!!! note
    **You can access your CEDAR form as many times as you want and updates any fields you want, until the form is as complete as it can be at the time of Platform registration.**

!!! note
    **As your study advances to a point at which additional metadata becomes available – such as a new publication or release of study data – we ask that you contact the Platform Help Desk at heal-support@datacommons.io to navigate updating your original study-level metadata.**

!!! note
    **ALL entries into this form may be used for HEAL investigator outreach, to provide data sharing support and extend data collaboration invitations, AND by the NIH HEAL office to track progress.**

    **MOUD defines medications for opioid use disorder, and OUD defines opioid use disorder.**
