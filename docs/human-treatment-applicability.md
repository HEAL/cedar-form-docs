        This field allows selection of a multiple answers from a limited set of possible answers. Please select all that apply. Possible answers are "Target Discovery","Target Mechanism", "Treatment Discovery", "Treatment Mechanism", "Treatment Efficacy", "Differential Treatment Efficacy", "Treatment Implementation", and "Treatment Availability or Accessibility". Examples of studies that would select each of these options:

    <details><summary>**How this field will be used**</summary><blockquote>
        The values from this field will likely be available as an "Advanced Search" filter on the HEAL Platform Discovery page, and will allow Platform users to quickly filter down to the broad type of study, study data, or study-generated knowledge in which they are most interested. **Examples include:** 
        <ul>
        <li> **Specifically looking for target discovery:** I'm a pharma company scientist with capacity to do high throughput screens for drug library impact on a target of interest and I want to be up on the research and discovery of novel targets for pain or opioid use treatment so that I can think about designing a screen to figure out how to drug those targets; I'm a local public health official or politician looking to implement some policies or resources to address the problem of opioid use relapse in my community and want to see if there are specific social or mental/behavioral determinants that have been identified as good targets for intervention to prevent opioid use relapse.  
        </li>
        <li> **Specifically looking for target mechanism:** I'm a researcher pain researcher doing target mechanism research for a specific target biomolecule - I want to see if anyone else is doing research on this mechanism that I can learn from, or using assays that I can adopt in my own target mechanism research; I'm a pharma company scientist - preliminary research to drug one target has failed due to unacceptable toxicity and I want to understand more about the original biomolecule target mechanism to see if there is another possible biomolecule target in the original target mechanism pathway that I can attempt to drug instead with acceptable toxicitiy levels
        </li>
        <li> **Specifically looking for treatment discovery:** I'm a family memnber of a person with OUD - my family member is allergic to methadone and has trouble remembering to take a daily pill of buprenorphine to keep their OUD in remission and I want to see what research is being done to develop new treatments for OUD that might work better for my family member; I'm a clinician treating pain or OUD patients - I want to keep up on the latest research into treatments relevant to my patient population so that I can make sure to get my patients access to the best treatment for them in a timely manner
        </li>
        <li> **Specifically looking for treatment mechanism:** I'm a pain or OUD patient - my doctor prescribed a new medication for my condition and I'm curious about how it works; I'm a clinician - I want to keep up to date on the research around the treatments I prescribe to my patients in order to understand who a specific treatment may work best for or whether there might be contraindications for example due to drug interactions; I'm a researcher at a pharma company and want to keep up to date on the research of how a drug at my or a competitor pharma company works to think about developing new drugs or formulations of the same drug that may yield increased efficacy and/or decreased side-effects
        </li>
        <li> **Specifically looking for treatment efficacy:** I'm a pain or opioid use patient and I heard about a novel treatment for my condition - I want to see if there are any studies looking at the efficacy of this novel treatment, maybe even differential efficacy to see if it might be particularly effective/ineffective for me; I'm a researcher trying to collate all of the evidence available on a specific treatment/intervention efficacy for a meta-analysis 
        </li>
        <li> **Specifically looking for treatment implementation:** I'm a clinician or administrator at a clinic or jail facility - I want to implement a specific intervention protocol for prevention of opioid overdose at my facility and I want to see if there's information about how best to implement this protocol 
        </li>
        <li>  **Specifically looking for treatment availability or accessibility:** I'm a pain or opioid use patient and I want to find substance use treatment facilities near me that also offer a specific type of treatment (e.g. MAT with buprenorphine); I'm a researcher who wants to understand the impact of treatment/intervention availability or accessibility on uptake and efficacy of the treatment or to use the relative availability or non-availability of a treatment across locations to design a natural experiment examining the efficacy of that treatment
