# Sharing your CEDAR form with other members of your study team

* One individual registers a study on the Platform, but multiple team members can collaborate on a form.
* Each team member needs a CEDAR account.
    * To create an account, visit [https://cedar.metadatacenter.org](https://cedar.metadatacenter.org).
    * Click “Register” below the Password line.
    * In the next window, enter your first name, last name, a functional email address, and a password.
* The registering member shares the study’s CEDAR form with other team members.
    * Click on the vertical three-dots to the right of the CEDAR Form in the CEDAR workspace and select "Share."
