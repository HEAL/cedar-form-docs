# (Meta)data Location

* [Expand](expand-or-collapse-cedar-form-section.md) the (Meta)data Location section. This section has two fields: 
  * NIH Application ID
  * Other Study-Associated Websites

## **NIH Application ID** 
The NIH Application ID auto-populates from NIH RePORTER.
  * For errors in this field, contact heal-support@datacommons.io immediately, and do NOT fill out the form until instructed to. Do NOT edit pre-populated fields. They will NOT save.

## **Other Study-Associated Websites**
The Other Study-Associated Websites field allows you to input an unlimited number of URLs. Provide URLs for any/all websites with information about your study.
Values in this field are validated as URLs and will not be accepted if improperly formatted: http(s)://youraddress.yourdomain.

## Single Entry
For a single entry, click the field and enter the value. Then, click “OK” to submit.

## Multiple URL Entries
For multiple entries:

* Click the field.
* Click the “1,2,3 list” toggle to the left of the “?” icon in the upper right corner (if you mouse over this icon it will say “Toggle View”).
* A spreadsheet interface will pop out.
* Double click and enter a value in each row until you are done.
* When you are done, click the “Toggle View” icon again (same location, but now looks like two small, solid triangles pointing away from each other).
* The spreadsheet will collapse and expose an “OK” button.
* Click “OK” to submit your values and exit the field.
  * The form will validate your URLs.
     * If any values do not pass validation, you will see a yellow warning triangle with an exclamation point and a message to enter valid URLs.
     * If all values pass validation, you will see a green circle icon with a check mark. 

* Once complete, [collapse](expand-or-collapse-cedar-form-section.md) the (Meta)data Location section (and [save](save-cedar-form.md) your form!)
