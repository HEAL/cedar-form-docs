# (Meta)data Location
* [Expand](expand-or-collapse-cedar-form-section.md) the (Meta)data Location form section 
* The (Meta)data Location form section has two fields: 
    * **NIH Application ID** 
        * The first field (i.e. NIH Application ID) should have been auto-populated by the Platform from metadata pulled in about your study from NIH RePORTER.  
        * If you notice an error in the NIH Application ID field, please email heal-support@datacommons.io to let us know right away, and do NOT proceed with filling out the remainder of the form until you receive guidance to do so. **Please do NOT edit the pre-populated NIH Application ID field yourself – these edits will NOT be saved.** 
    * **Other Study-Associated Websites**
        * The Other Study-Associated Websites field allow entry of an unlimited number of urls. Please provide the urls for any/all websites that provide information about your study (e.g. some studies have a study webpage). 
        * Values in this field are **validated as urls** and will not be accepted if they do not conform to the required format; enter values as http(s)://youraddress.yourdomain. 
        * This is an [**array type field**](complete-cedar-array-field.md) which accepts multiple values. 
        * For an array type field, if you have only one value to enter, click into the field and enter the value by typing or copy/pasting the value in. Click the “OK” button to submit this value. 
        * If you have more than one value to enter:
            * click into the field, 
            * click on the “1,2,3 list” toggle view icon just to the left of the “?” icon in the upper right corner of the gray field area (if you mouse over this icon it will say “Toggle View”). 
            * this will pop out a spreadsheet type interface. 
            * enter a new value in each row of the spreadsheet interface by double clicking into the row and typing or copy/pasting the value 
            * when you are done entering values, click the “Toggle View” icon again (the icon is in the same spot as the first time you clicked it, but now looks like two small filled-in triangles pointing outward from each other) 
            * this will collapse the spreadsheet view and expose the “OK” button 
            * click the "OK" button to submit the values and exit the field
            * because values in this field are validated as urls, the form will automatically attempt to validate the url addresses you enter in this field; 
                * if any values do not pass the url validation step, a yellow warning triangle icon with an exclamation point will appear in the field along with a message asking you to enter valid urls
                * if all values pass the url validation step, a green circle icon with a checkmark will appear in the field   
* Once complete, [collapse](expand-or-collapse-cedar-form-section.md) the (Meta)data Location section (and [save](save-cedar-form.md) your form!)
