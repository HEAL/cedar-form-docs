# Data Availability
* [Expand](expand-or-collapse-cedar-form-section.md) the Data Availability form section 
* The Data Availability form section has ten fields (<mark>click below to expand guidance for each field</mark>):
 
    <details><summary>**Will the study collect or produce data? Yes/No**</summary> 

    * **How to answer:** Not all HEAL studies will collect or produce data. For example, some studies will do the ‘pre-work’ of developing methods and protocols for later use by future studies that will implement and collect data using that developed protocol. If your study will NOT collect or produce **data**, but will produce shareable products other than data (e.g. protocols, slide decks, etc.) please answer “No” to this question and “Yes” to a later question in this section that asks if your study will produce shareable products other than data. 
    * **How this field will be used:** This field will allow Platform users that are specifically looking for study data that may be useful for their purposes to filter down to studies that will collect or produce data, and filter out those studies that will not collect or produce data. <mark>This field may also be used by the Platform to flag studies for outreach to HEAL investigators based on their answers to provide data sharing support and extend data collaboration invitations.</mark>

    <details><summary>**Will the study make data available? None/Some/All**</summary>

    * **How to answer:** <mark>This field ONLY APPLIES if you answered “Yes” to “Will the study collect or produce data?”</mark> If your study does not plan to make any of the data you collect or produce available in a HEAL approved data repository, select “None” (while most HEAL studies are obligated by the terms of their award to share data, this may apply to select HEAL studies – e.g. SBIR grants). If your study plans to make some data available, but not all (e.g. only data needed to reproduce publications, only processed data files, only extensively de-identified data, excluding certain data sets or sources used in your study such as administrative data when the DSA under which you obtained them does not allow sharing, etc.), select “Some”. If your study plans to make all data available to the greatest extent possible (e.g. sharing very close to raw clinical trial data in a data repository with strong access control mechanisms and subject to very strong access controls, including some features data that may be very useful for specific analysis but also pose a real risk of re-identification, such as highly granular geographic information, detailed diagnostic and care provision or utilization patterns, and/or clinician notes), select “All”.  
    * **How this field will be used:** This field will allow Platform users that are specifically looking for study data that may be useful for their purposes to filter down to studies that will share some or all of the data they collect or produce, and filter out those studies that will not share data. Some users, especially those who may be interested specifically in data features that represent substantial risk of re-identification in a dataset (e.g. high geographic granularity), may specifically want to filter down to studies that plan to share “All” data in order to filter out studies that will only share extensively de-identified data. <mark>This field may also be used by the Platform to flag studies for outreach to HEAL investigators based on their answers to provide data sharing support and extend data collaboration invitations.</mark>

    <details><summary>**Will available data have restrictions on access? None/Some/All**</summary>

    * **How to answer:**<mark>This field ONLY APPLIES if you answered “Yes” to “Will the study collect or produce data?” and you answered “Some” or “All” to “Will the study make data available?”</mark> If your study plans for all the data that it makes available in a data repository to be open access or very minimally restricted (i.e. available following signing of a minimal DUA that does not require any manual intervention or approval), then select “None”. If your study plans for some of the data that it makes available in a data repository to be open access or very minimally restricted (i.e. available following signing of a minimal DUA that does not require any manual intervention or approval), while some of the data that it makes available will be available only following a request and approval process that does require substantial manual intervention (e.g. submission of a project proposal and IRB approval by the requestor; review by a Data Access Committee on the repository end; etc.), then select “Some”. An example of a study that may choose this option is a clinical trial that will share both 1) an extensively de-identified dataset that is open access/minimal access controls, AND 2) a less de-identified dataset that includes features that add value for many analysis questions, but also present substantial risk for re-identification, that is shared via the repository under strict access controls. If your study plans for all of the data that it makes available in a data repository to be available only following a request and approval process that does require substantial manual intervention (e.g. submission of a project proposal and IRB approval by the requestor; review by a Data Access Committee on the repository end; etc.), then select “All”. An example of a study that may choose this option is a clinical trial that will ONLY share a less de-identified dataset that includes features that add value for many analysis questions, but also present substantial risk for re-identification, that is shared via the repository under strict access controls, and WILL NOT share a version of the data that is extensively de-identified as open access/minimal access controls. 

    * **How this field will be used:** This field will allow Platform users that are specifically looking for study data that may be useful for their purposes AND very easy to quickly access (e.g. because they want to execute a project quickly, perhaps prior to a newspaper article or proposal deadline) to filter down to studies that will share some or all of the data they collect or produce as open access/minimal access controls. <mark>This field may also be used by the Platform to flag studies for outreach to HEAL investigators based on their answers to provide data sharing support and extend data collaboration invitations.</mark>

    <details><summary>**Has data collection/production started? Not started/Started/Finished**</summary>

    * **How to answer:** <mark>This field ONLY APPLIES if you answered “Yes” to “Will the study collect or produce data?”</mark> If your study has not started collecting data at all, select “Not started”. If your study has multiple parts/aims, select this option if NO part/aim of your study has started collecting data. If your study has started collecting data but is not finished, select “Started”. If your study has multiple parts/aims, select this option if any part/aim of your study has started collecting data. If your study has finished collecting data, select “Finished”. If your study has multiple parts/aims, select this option if ALL parts/aims of your study have finished collecting data.
    * **How this field will be used:** This field will allow Platform users that are specifically looking for study data that may be useful for their purposes to filter down to studies that are at different stages of data collection. Filtering to studies that are at later stages of data collection (e.g. “Started” or “Finished”) will allow Platform users to find studies that are closer to having data available for request by Platform users. This field will also allow Platform users that may not be interested in obtaining study data, but are interested solely in the findings/results of the study, to filter down to studies where it’s likely that a study publication with findings/results can be expected soon. <mark>This field may also be used by the Platform to flag studies for outreach to HEAL investigators based on their answers to provide data sharing support and extend data collaboration invitations AND by the NIH HEAL office to track HEAL data collection progress.</mark>

    <details><summary>**Has data release started? Not started/Started/Finished**</summary>
    * **How to answer:** <mark>This field ONLY APPLIES if you answered “Yes” to “Will the study collect or produce data?” AND you answered “Some” or “All” to “Will the study make data available?”</mark> If your study has not started making study data available via the data repository chosen for long-term data sharing purposes by the study, select “Not started”. If your study has multiple parts/aims, select this option if NO part/aim of your study has started making study data available via a data repository. If your study has started making study data available via the data repository chosen for long-term data sharing purposes by the study but is not finished (i.e. will share more data at a later date), select “Started”. If your study has multiple parts/aims, select this option if any part/aim of your study has started making study data available via a data repository. If your study has finished making study data available via the data repository chosen for long-term data sharing purposes by the study (i.e. there is not a plan to share any more data at a later date), select “Finished”. If your study has multiple parts/aims, select this option if all parts/aims of your study have finished making study data available via a data repository.
    * **How this field will be used:** This field will allow Platform users that are specifically looking for study data that may be useful for their purposes to filter down to studies that are at different stages of data release. Filtering to studies that are at later stages of data release (e.g. “Started” or “Finished”) will allow Platform users to find studies that already have data available for request by Platform users, and are closer to having all study data available for request by Platform users.  This field will also allow Platform users that may not be interested in obtaining study data, but are interested solely in the findings/results of the study, to filter down to studies where it’s likely that a study publication with findings/results can be expected soon, if not already available. <mark>This field may also be used by the Platform to flag studies for outreach to HEAL investigators based on their answers to provide data sharing support and extend data collaboration invitations AND by the NIH HEAL office to track HEAL data release/sharing progress.</mark>
