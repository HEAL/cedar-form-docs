# Study Translational Focus
* [Expand](expand-or-collapse-cedar-form-section.md) the Study Translational Focus form section
* Context for the Study Translational Focus form section:
    * The HEAL initiative is founded around the goal of **finding solutions to the human problem** of deaths and other negative consequences of <u>opioid use</u> disorder, opioid overdose, and opioid exposure. 
    * The HEAL initiative also focuses on **finding solutions to the human problem** of <u>pain</u> and pain management (largely because treatment of pain with opioids has played and continues to play a substantial role in initiation of opioid use disorder in pain patients, and in increasing the national supply of and access to opioid pills both for pain patients and the general population, thereby increasing risk of exposure to and uptake of opioids among these populations)
    * Even when HEAL studies don’t involve human subjects, the eventual intention is that the study results from nearly all HEAL studies will be relavent to, and in some way focused on, 1) learning more about the human health conditions of opioid use disorder and/or pain (**Condition-focused studies**), or on 2) treatments, interventions, or solutions targeting opioid use or pain conditions that act at the individual or community level on humans (**Treatment-focused studies**).
        * **HEAL Condition-focused studies**: Some may be doing exploratory work to better understand incidence of, risk for, mechanism of, impact of, public attitudes towards or perception of human opioid or pain conditions.
        * **HEAL Treatment-focused studies**: Focused on individual or community level treatments for human opioid or pain conditions; many HEAL studies will be investigating the potential for treatments, interventions, or solutions at some stage – very early/discovery stage of either targets or mechanisms to impact those targets, efficacy of a mechanism to impact a target, implementation. Some studies or data collection efforts may be more focused on understanding the access or availability of treatments, interventions, or solution (e.g. SAMHSA N-SSATS and N-MHSS datasets)
* Just as many/the majority of HEAL studies can be thought of as either condition- or treatment-focused, we expect that folks from a wide variety of roles coming to the HEAL Platform (HEAL Platform users) will also generally be looking for studies, study data, and study-generated knowledge in a condition- or treatment-focused manner; they will want to find studies, study data, and study-generated knowledge that allow them to better study and/or understand 1) a human opoid or pain condition and/or 2) treatments, interventions, or solutions at the individual or community level that address human opioid or pain conditions.
* We expect that metadata entered in this section (including identification of your study as either Condition- or Treatment-focused) will allow Platform users to quickly filter down to the broad type of study, study data, or study-generated knowledge in which they are most interested
* In the case that your HEAL study does not fit the case of being either Condition- or Treatment-focused (e.g. some HEAL funded work will focus on career development, increasing diversity, developing general study recruitment or consenting procedures, etc.), please skip the fields in this form section. **Please feel free to reach out to us at heal-support@datacommons.io if you are unsure or could use some guidance - we are happy to help!**
