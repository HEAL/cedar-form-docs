# Study Translational Focus
* [Expand](expand-or-collapse-cedar-form-section.md) the Study Translational Focus form section

*  **Context for the Study Translational Focus form section:**
    * The HEAL initiative is founded around the goal of **finding solutions to the human problem** of deaths and other negative consequences of <u>opioid use</u> disorder, opioid overdose, and opioid exposure. 
    * The HEAL initiative also focuses on **finding solutions to the human problem** of <u>pain</u> and pain management (largely because treatment of pain with opioids has played and continues to play a substantial role in initiation of opioid use disorder in pain patients, and in increasing the national supply of and access to opioid pills both for pain patients and the general population, thereby increasing risk of exposure to and uptake of opioids among these populations)
    * Even when HEAL studies don’t involve human subjects, the eventual intention is that the study results from nearly all HEAL studies will be relevent to, and in some way focused on, 1) learning more about the human health conditions of opioid use disorder and/or pain (**Condition-focused studies**), or on 2) treatments, interventions, or solutions targeting opioid use or pain conditions that act at the individual or community level on humans (**Treatment-focused studies**).
        * <u>**HEAL Condition-focused studies:**</u> Study results will be relevent to, and/or in some way focused on, learning more about the human health conditions of opioid use disorder and/or pain. Some may be doing work to better understand incidence of, risk for, mechanism of, impact of, public attitudes towards or perception of human opioid or pain conditions.
        * <u>**HEAL Treatment-focused studies:**</u> study results will be relevent to, and/or in some way focused on, treatments, interventions, or solutions targeting opioid use or pain conditions. Focused on individual or community level treatments for human opioid or pain conditions; many HEAL studies will be investigating the potential for treatments, interventions, or solutions at some stage – very early/discovery stage of either targets or mechanisms to impact those targets, efficacy of a mechanism to impact a target, implementation. Some studies or data collection efforts may be more focused on understanding the access or availability of treatments, interventions, or solution (e.g. SAMHSA N-SSATS and N-MHSS datasets)
    * Just as many/the majority of HEAL studies can be thought of as either condition- or treatment-focused, we expect that folks from a wide variety of roles coming to the HEAL Platform (HEAL Platform users) will also generally be looking for studies, study data, and study-generated knowledge in a condition- or treatment-focused manner; they will want to find studies, study data, and study-generated knowledge that allow them to better study and/or understand 1) a human opoid or pain condition and/or 2) treatments, interventions, or solutions at the individual or community level that address human opioid or pain conditions.
    * We expect that metadata entered in this section (including identification of your study as either Condition- or Treatment-focused) will allow Platform users to quickly filter down to the broad type of study, study data, or study-generated knowledge in which they are most interested
    * In the case that your HEAL study does not fit the case of being either Condition- or Treatment-focused (e.g. some HEAL funded work will focus on career development, increasing diversity, developing general study recruitment or consenting procedures, etc.), please skip the fields in this form section. **Please feel free to reach out to us at heal-support@datacommons.io if you are unsure or could use some guidance - we are happy to help!**

* The Study Translational Focus form section has two fields (<mark>click below to expand guidance for each field</mark>):

    <details><summary>**How to answer**</summary><blockquote>
        This field allows selection of a single answer from a limited set of possible answers. Possible answers are "Condition" for Condition-focused studies, and "Treatment" for Treatment-focused studies. See above for definitions of these different types of studies. In the case of <u>human subjects studies</u>, a Condition-focused study might look like an observational prospective cohort study following developmental markers in babies exposed to opioids in utero from birth through adolesence; a Treatment-focused study might look like a randomized control trial testing efficacy of a novel non-opioid drug for pain versus status quo use of an opioid drug. In the case of <u>basic science or non-human subjects studies</u>, a Condition-focused study might look like a biochemical study investigating the molecular mechanisms of cell signalling in pain/nociception; a Treatment-focused study might look a small molecule screen to discover chemical drugs that activate or deactivate a molecular target involved in opioid-addictive or overdose pathways.

    <details><summary>**How this field will be used**</summary><blockquote>
        The values from this field will likely be available as an "Advanced Search" filter on the HEAL Platform Discovery page. As noted above, we expect that folks from a wide variety of roles coming to the HEAL Platform (HEAL Platform users) will often be looking for studies, study data, and study-generated knowledge in a condition- or treatment-focused manner; They will want to find studies, study data, and study-generated knowledge that allow them to better study and/or understand 1) a human opoid or pain condition and/or 2) treatments, interventions, or solutions at the individual or community level that address human opioid or pain conditions. We expect that identification of your study as either Condition- or Treatment-focused will allow Platform users to quickly filter down to the broad type of study, study data, or study-generated knowledge in which they are most interested

    <details><summary>**How to answer**</summary><blockquote> 
        <ul>
        <li> This field allows selection of multiple answers from a limited set of possible answers. Please choose all that apply.Possible answers are "Biology and Health", "Mental Health", "Social Determinants", and "Public Attitudes or Stigma".
        </li> 
        <li> If your study is <u>**Condition-focused**</u>, think about what types of determinants or mechanisms of the human opioid or pain condition you are investigating:
            <ul> 
            <li> a study focused on molecular or biophysical mechanism of bodily injury and pain perception would select "Biology and Health"
            </li> 
            <li> an observational study measuring the incidence and timing of onset of rumination and other anxiety or depressive symptoms/states in patients that do or do not transition from acute to chronic pain would select "Mental Health"
            </li>
            <li> if the same study also measures items such as income and education level, family support, access to healthcare and food, etc. then they would ALSO select "Social Determinants"
            </li>
            <li> if the same study also measures items such as the individual's perceived level of stigma from friends/family/employers around their pain experience they they would also select "Public Attitudes or Stigma" 
            </li>
            <li> a survey study of a random sample of Americans asking these individuals about their own attitudes towards individuals with opioid use disorder would select "Public Attitudes or Stigma"; they may also select "Social Determinants" (since public attitudes and stigma are a subset of all social determinants) 
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li> If your study is <u>**Treatment-focused**</u>, think about the mechanism of the treatment, intervention or solution you are investigating:
            <ul> 
            <li> a small molecule screen study looking for drugs that inhibit a novel protein target in the opioid reward pathway as a possible drug candidate to treat opioid use disorder, or a study investigating efficacy of a drug or surgical procedure to treat chronic back pain, would select "Biology and Health"
            </li> 
            <li> a study investigating relative efficacy of group therapy versus one-on-one therapy to prevent opioid use relapse would select "Mental Health"
            </li>
            <li> a study investigating efficacy of providing individuals with a history of opioid use who are leaving jail with either medication for opioid use disorder (MOUD) alone or MOUD plus supports such as housing, food, and education/employment assistance would select "Biology and Health" AND "Social Determinants"
            </li>
            <li> a study investigating efficacy of a community-level communications campaign focused on a central message of opioid use disorder as a disease of health condition to change publica attitudes/reduce stigma towards individuals with opioid use disorder would select "Public Attitudes or Stigma" 
            </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        </ul>

    <details><summary>**How this field will be used**</summary><blockquote> 
        The values from this field will likely be available as an "Advanced Search" filter on the HEAL Platform Discovery page. Platform users looking for information about treatments for a human opioid use or pain condition may specifically be interested in a certain type of treatment mode and can use this field to filter down to the studies in which they are most interested; A patient with opioid use disorder may want to specifically look for something like a mental health intervention/treatment because they are reluctant to use medication to treat their condition, or they are in a rehab facility that does not allow medication (filter on value "Mental Health"); A pain clinician who has historically treated patients with opioid drugs and seen some patients become addicted may specifically want to look for information on any non-opioid drugs for treating pain (filter on value "Biology and Health"); A public health official in an area with high rates of opioid overdose despite high naloxone availability might suspect that social determinants (e.g. attitudes/stigma, lack of communication/education, lack of transportation to distribution centers, etc.) are playing a role in low uptake/effective use of naloxone to prevent overdoses (filter on value "Social Determinants"). Filtering on this field will allow Platform users to quickly filter down to the broad type of study, study data, or study-generated knowledge in which they are most interested
