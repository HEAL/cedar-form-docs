<p><details><summary><strong>How to answer</strong></summary><blockquote>
    This field allows selection of a multiple answers from a limited set of possible answers. Please select all that apply. Possible answers are "Target Discovery","Target Mechanism", "Treatment Discovery", "Treatment Mechanism", "Treatment Efficacy", "Differential Treatment Efficacy", "Treatment Implementation", and "Treatment Availability or Accessibility". Examples of studies that would select each of these options:
    <ul> 
    <li> <strong>Target discovery:</strong> Some general examples include a study focused on identification of a molecular target that treats pain that is not in the brain to avoid neurological/addictive effects, or a study focused on identification of a specific social determinant of health that is most impactful on post-surgical pain outcome. Some more specific examples include: A study that has developed RNAi reagants against several different proteins in the nociception signaling pathway and is using these reagants to knockdown each of these proteins and observe resulting modifications to pain response in mice to determine which protein(s) may be good targets of a drug or other intervention to modify pain perception in humans; A longitudinal cohort study following a cohort of adults at high risk of injury (e.g. construction workers) that measures aspects of mental health, social support and connectivity, economic stability, political engagement, sense of agency, physical environment, etc. using multiple metrics each at regular timepoints and intends to investigate relationships between these broad sectors and incidence of injury and/or transition of acute to chronic pain following incidence of injury to determine which of these broad sectors may be good targets of an intervention of some kind to modify risk of injury or transition from acute to chronic pain in the case of injury in adults at high risk of injury      <br />
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Target mechanism:</strong> A basic science study using RNAseq and/or mass spectrometry on extracts of cultured mouse DRG neurons before and after exposure to an in vitro heat pain stimulus model (<a href="https://www.pnas.org/doi/epdf/10.1073/pnas.93.26.15435">ref</a>), and with or without application of RNAi or chemical inhibitor of a target molecule in the nociception pathway, to investigate the role of the target molecule in modulating level and state of mRNA and proteins in neurons following a pain stimulus; A qualitative study using focus groups and interviews to investigate why certain aspects of a person's economic stability and/or physical environment such as access to green space and well-maintained walkways seem to correspond with lower risk of transition from acute to chronic pain in adults with lower back injury; 
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Treatment discovery:</strong> A small molecule screen to identify a chemical drug capable of inhibiting the enzymatic activity of a molecular protein signaling target in the nociception signaling pathway; A study that identifies groups of adults at high risk of injury that by chance were exposed to different interventions on environmental conditions that impacted their access to green space (e.g. construction workers that live in different states or cities around the country or even parts of the same city where the city or city area may have used pandemic funding to improve existing park space, facilities, or park programming, or add new mini-parks, or improve public transportation to parks, or improve walking infrastructure like sidewalks, crosswalks, parkway trees, benches, or water fountains on the way to parks), or to no intervention, and is able to follow incidence of injury and rate of conversion of acute to chronic pain among those who are injured in these groups to investigate which, if any, of these different environmental interventions shows potential for reducing risk of injury and/or risk of acute to chronic pain conversion following injury 
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Treatment mechanism:</strong> A basic science study investigating molecular mechanism of aspects of the immune response to opioid vaccines that are not B-cell/antibody-mediated; A study testing efficacy of a combination of nurse home visits and monthly unconditional cash transfers to new mothers to improve child development outcomes in newborns exposed to opioids in utero that includes arms of the study with both components of the treatment and each single component alone to parse the role of each intervention component in driving outcomes (select "Treatment Mechansim" and "Treatment Efficacy")<br />
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Treatment efficacy:</strong> A stage 3 clinical trial RCT randomizing half of individuals to use of a minimally invasive, implanted MOUD-dispensing device plus daily dummy MOUD pills and half to a dummy device and real MOUD pills to test efficacy of the device in preventing OUD relapse; A natural experiment study taking advantage of the temporal difference in adoption of Medicaid expansion across states to test the efficacy of Medicaid expansion as an intervention to increase the rate at which individuals with OUD are given and fill a prescription for MOUD<br />
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Treatment implementation:</strong> A study testing efficacy of a mental health and social determinants screening survey to guide OUD treatment decisions in community hospital-based physician practices that also collects qualitative and quantitative data on various aspects and metrics of implementation of the screening mechanism in this type of practice setting that may aid others implementing this type of intervention in the future (select "Treatment Implementation" AND "Treatment Efficacy"); A pilot study testing efficacy of a novel, minimally invasive, implanted MOUD dispensing device for the treatment of OUD patients at high risk of relapse that also collects qualitative and quantitative data on various aspects and metrics of implementation of the screening process to identify appropriate patients, communication content and delivery to patients in advising them of their treatment options, protocols and procedures for implantation as well as follow-up appointments, care and contact with the patient and any differences in these based on site of implantation, all of which may aid others implementing this type of intervention in the future (select "Treatment Implementation" AND "Treatment Efficacy"); A pilot study testing efficacy of setting up community-based safe injection facilities and also collecting implementation data that may aid others implementing this type of intervention in the future (select "Treatment Implementation" AND "Treatment Efficacy")  <br />
    </li>
    <li>  <strong>Treatment availability or accessibility:</strong> A study surveying all substance use facilities in the country that receive any federal dollars about whether they offer OUD treatments and if so, what modes of treatment (e.g. in/outpatient, MOUD/methadone/buprenorphine), and to who do they offer treatment (e.g. any restrictions based on gender, age, health insurance, co-occurring mental health conditions, etc.); A study using EHR and claims data to investigate sociodemographic disparities in how frequently patients with OUD are given a prescription for MOUD, or in how frequently patients fill prescriptions for MOUD

    </li>
    <li> <strong>Specifically looking for treatment efficacy:</strong> I'm a pain or opioid use patient and I heard about a novel treatment for my condition - I want to see if there are any studies looking at the efficacy of this novel treatment, maybe even differential efficacy to see if it might be particularly effective/ineffective for me; I'm a researcher trying to collate all of the evidence available on a specific treatment/intervention efficacy for a meta-analysis 
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Specifically looking for treatment implementation:</strong> I'm a clinician or administrator at a clinic or jail facility - I want to implement a specific intervention protocol for prevention of opioid overdose at my facility and I want to see if there's information about how best to implement this protocol 
    </li>
    <li>  <strong>Specifically looking for treatment availability or accessibility:</strong> I'm a pain or opioid use patient and I want to find substance use treatment facilities near me that also offer a specific type of treatment (e.g. MAT with buprenorphine); I'm a researcher who wants to understand the impact of treatment/intervention availability or accessibility on uptake and efficacy of the treatment or to use the relative availability or non-availability of a treatment across locations to design a natural experiment examining the efficacy of that treatment

    This field allows selection of a multiple answers from a limited set of possible answers. Please select all that apply. Possible answers are "Individual","Population". <u>Please consider:</u> Is the treatment, intervention, or solution my study is relevant to applied at the individual level (e.g. a doctor prescribes a drug or physical therapy regimen to a patient) or at the population/community/group level (e.g. a city changes good samaritan naloxone laws, or implements a safe needle exchange center or communications/education campaign, or adds park maintenance resources to the budget to provide more access to outside places to exercise)? Examples of studies that would select each of these options:
    <ul> 
    <li> <strong>Individual:</strong>  <br />
    </li>
    <li> <strong>Population:</strong> 
    </li>
