    If you are studying a human <strong>pain</strong> condition or a <strong>pain</strong> treatment, intervention, or solution, is there a source/causal condition(s) for the pain condition? If so, indicate it here (e.g. A study investigating mechanism of, or risk for, disabling chronic pain in fibromyalgia patients would select “fibromyalgia”; A study measuring incidence and intensity of pain following back surgery would select “surgery” and/or “failed back surgery syndrome"). NLM MeSH allows you to be general (e.g. “chronic disease," “multiple chronic conditions”) and/or specific (e.g. “end stage liver disease," “osteoarthritis, knee”).

    This field is an array. The controlled vocabulary/pick-list is the NLM MeSH (National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings – see the tree view of this vocabulary <a href="https://meshb.nlm.nih.gov/treeView">here</a>), which covers a wide-ranging set of terms over many health-related categories including <strong>Diseases/Health Conditions</strong> (containing most terms you will need for this field). When you first click into this field, you may see an “odd” value, belonging to a category of NLM MeSH that does not apply to this field. Ignore that. Start typing the health condition of interest, and the drop down list will populate with items based on your inputs.

    <br>
    For condition studies, what (if any) other causally related conditions is the study measuring, observing, understanding, or otherwise investigating? For treatment studies, what condition and treatment outcomes are being measured? <strong>For example:</strong> </p>
<ul>
<li>A basic science study, using single cell DRG neuron pain stimuli exposures (in cultures), to investigate the timing and mechanistic relationship, at the cellular level, between acute pain signaling and transition to chronic pain signaling signatures (Causal condition: <strong>“pain," “acute pain”</strong>; Target condition: <strong>“pain," “acute pain”</strong>; Outcome condition: <strong>“pain,"“chronic pain”</strong>). 
    <br></li>
</ul>
<p>NLM MeSH allows you to be general (e.g. “chronic disease," “multiple chronic conditions”) and/or specific (e.g. “end stage liver disease," “osteoarthritis, knee”). Use this range of specificity to add all applicable terms.

    The values from this field will likely be available either as 1) an "Advanced Search" filter on the HEAL Platform Discovery page (depending on the range of answers across HEAL studies we get for this field, a simple filter may not be useful if the list is too long; we may be able to implement an auto-complete feature that would make a long filter list tenable and retain utility), to will allow Platform users to quickly filter down to the broad type of study, study data, or study-generated knowledge in which they are most interested, and/or as 2) accessible to free text search and discovery tools that leverage elastic and semantic search to make it possible for Platform users to find your study based on the exact term you selected, or a close/related match to that term. <strong>Examples include:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>I'm a clinician who treats fibromyalgia patients and want to find research/data that may point to ways to better address fibromyalgia-associated pain, especially with the goal of increasing the functional status of my patients (filter on Causal condition: <strong>"fibromyalgia"</strong>; Target condition: <strong>"pain", "chronic pain"</strong>; Outcome condition: <strong>"physical function"</strong>)</li>
<li>I'm a clinician who treats fibromyalgia patients and want to find research/data that may point to ways to better address/treat the underlying disease to make development of fibromyalgia-associated pain less likely or severe (filter on Causal condition: <strong>"fibromyalgia"</strong>; Target condition: <strong>"fibromyalgia"</strong>; Outcome condition: <strong>"pain", "chronic pain"</strong>)</li>
<li>I'm a patient with end stage renal disease and a lot of associated pain - I want to see what research is going on to develop treatments for pain in ESRD patients, to reduce pain and pain-associated sleep deprivation (filter on Causal condition: "end stage renal disease" or <strong>"chronic kidney disease"</strong>; Target condition: <strong>"pain", "chronic pain"</strong>; Outcome condition: <strong>"pain"</strong>, <strong>"chronic pain"</strong>, <strong>"sleep deprivation"</strong>)</li>
<li>I'm a mayor of a town with crisis rates of deaths from opioid overdose and I want to look for interventions that will reduce these immediate catastrophic harms in my town as soon as possible (filter on Causal condition: Not applicable (non-pain condition focus); Target condition: <strong>"opiate overdose"</strong>; Outcome condition: <strong>"death"</strong>)

    For condition studies, what (if any) other causally related conditions is the study measuring, observing, understanding, or otherwise investigating? For treatment studies, what condition and treatment outcomes are being measured? <strong>For example:</strong>
    <br></p>
<ul>
<li>A trial to determine efficacy of modifying ESRD dialysis regimens to reduce pain and mortality, while collecting self-reported baseline (and other) depression and anxiety metrics (Causal condition: “end stage renal disease”; Target condition: end stage renal disease; Outcome condition: <strong>“pain,"“death”</strong>; Other condition: <strong>“depression,"“anxiety," “mental health”</strong>)</li>
<li>A basic science study, using single cell DRG neuron pain stimuli exposures (in cultures), to investigate the timing and mechanistic relationship, at the cellular level, between acute pain signaling and transition to chronic pain signaling signatures, while also measuring neuron inflammatory molecule/ cytokine production status (Causal condition: <strong>“pain," “acute pain”</strong>; Target condition: <strong>“pain," “acute pain”</strong>; Outcome condition: <strong>“pain,"“chronic pain”</strong>; Other condition: <strong>“inflammation,"“neurogenic inflammation”</strong>).
