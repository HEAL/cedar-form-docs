When you first click into this field, you may see some \"odd\" looking values that belong to a category of the NLM MeSH that does not apply well to this field. If you start typing in the health condition you are looking for (e.g. start typing in the first letters of the health condition \"fibromyalgia\"), the drop down list will populate with items that start with the typed in letters and you should be able to find your condition of interest.

If yes, please indicate the causal condition(s) here. E.g. A study investigating mechanism of or risk for disabling chronic pain in fibromyalgia patients would select the condition \"fibromyalgia\"; A study measuring incidence and intensity of pain following back surgery would select \"surgery\" and/or \"failed back surgery syndrome\". NLM MeSH allows you to be quite general (e.g. \"chronic disease\", \"multiple chronic conditions\") and/or quite specific (e.g. \"end stage liver disease\", \"osteoarthritis, knee\").
