Relevant Opioid use and/or Pain condition - Category(ies) How to answer This field allows multiple selections, included in the full metadata model definitions . Select all that apply. Regardless of study type, HEAL studies pertain to understanding more about human pain or opioid related conditions and/or related treatments, interventions, or solutions. Which human pain or opioid related condition(s) does your study contribute to understanding? For example: A pragmatic clinical trial to treat fibromyalgia pain with a combination of physical therapy and electro physiotherapy, would likely select \u201cPain,\" \u201cPain, chronic,\" and \u201cPain, resulting from chronic illness.\u201d A basic biochemistry study to understand the mechanism of fentanyl binding to opioid receptors in the brain and the resulting signaling triggered systems, might choose \u201cOpioid overdose\u201d and/or \u201cOpioid use and opioid use disorder.\u201d How this field will be used These values will likely be filterable under \u201cAdvanced Search\u201d on the HEAL Platform Discovery page, and will allow users to quickly find broad, relevant studies, study data, or study-generated knowledge. For example: Opioid Exposure: A pre-K/K school teacher knows their surrounding community has high rates of OUD and wonders if student behavioral issues can be attributed to in utero opioid exposure. They also want to recognize exposure impacts and support intervention for students and their parents. Opioid use and opioid use disorder, relapse; Opioid use and opioid use disorder, chronic: A family member or case manager of a person at high risk of relapse and taking medication for chronic OUD, wants to identify appropriate OUD treatment(s), and learn about geographic and other factors impacting treatment access. Opioid use and opioid use disorder, relapse: A clinician treating OUD notices a high rate of relapse in patients. They seek research on relapse risk factors, or preventive and therapeutic interventions to target OUD relapse. Pain, acute; Pain, resulting from surgery: A patient scheduled for surgery, whose doctor recommends opioids for acute post-surgical pain, does not want to take opioids due to addiction risks or triggering a relapse (if they have a previous OUD) and seeks research on non-drug or non-opioid treatments to address acute post-surgical pain. Opioid use and/or Pain condition - Investigation Stage or Type How to answer This field allows multiple selections, included in the full metadata model definitions . Select all that apply. For example: Incidence of condition: A national survey about pain experience A study using admin data, healthcare claims, or fire department and ambulance run data to estimate opioid overdose incidences per county in IL Risk (or differential risk) of condition: A study looking for biomarkers of those at higher risk of opioid dependence following short term use for acute post surgical pain A study looking at differential risk, by strata, of sociodemographic factors for pain-related condition development, in circumstances like end stage renal disease or fibromyalgia Mechanism of condition: A natural experiment to investigate biological or social/environmental factors that explain differential risk for pain related condition like end stage renal disease or fibromyalgia, across the strata of sociodemographic factors Impact of condition: A study investigating OUD\u2019s impact on the likelihood of completing a degree, getting a job, starting/maintaining a family or romantic relationship, or securing/maintaining housing A study investigating the impact of a high community OUD rate on community crime levels, economic stability, and social cohesion Public attitudes towards or perception of a condition: A national survey asking for attitudes about 1) employing those with OUD, 2) befriending them, 3) having them marry into the family, 4) allowing them access to public funding for long term medical and social support treatment A study testing efficacy of a community-based communications and education campaign to increase previous OUD sufferers\u2019 employability Treatment of a condition: A study investigating whether providing housing and job training support, to people leaving jail on an opioid use or possession charge, prevents OUD relapse or further involvement in the criminal justice system A phase 3 clinical trial investigating efficacy of a novel non-opioid drug to treat chronic pain A study investigating whether a novel implanted device, providing long-term and slow release of an established MAT drug for OUD, can prevent relapse How this field will be used These values will likely be filterable under \u201cAdvanced Search\u201d on the HEAL Platform Discovery page and will allow users to quickly find broad, relevant studies, study data, or study-generated knowledge. Examples include: A school teacher who knows the local community has high OUD rates and: Impact of condition: wonders if student behavioral issues may be attributed in utero exposure to opioids and Treatment of condition: how to recognize exposure impacts, to provide support and intervention for students and parents, while Public attitudes towards or perception of a condition: learning about how/how much opioid use stigma should weigh into an offer to help, as it may expose them to further stigma-related harm A clinician treating OUD patients notices a high rate of patient relapse, who Risk for condition; Differential risk for condition: seeks research on relapse risk factors or Treatment of condition: on preventive or therapeutic interventions that target OUD relapse A patient scheduled for surgery, whose doctor recommended opioids for acute post-surgical pain but Risk for condition; Differential risk for condition: does not want to take opioids because they worry about opioid addiction, or (with a previous OUD) triggering a relapse, and wants to find research on clear risk factors for these outcomes, and/or Incidence of condition; Differential risk for Condition: rates for these negative outcomes is in the general population or populations with known risk factors Pain - Causal condition ( Alias: Causal Condition ) How to answer This field ONLY APPLIES to your study if you selected \u201cPain\u201d and/or a modifier of \u201cPain\u201d (e.g. \u201cPain, chronic\u201d) for the \u201cRelevant Opioid use and/or Pain condition\u201d category(ies) above. This field allows multiple selections. Select all that apply. This field is an array. The controlled vocabulary/pick-list is the NLM MeSH (National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings \u2013 see the tree view of this vocabulary here ), which covers a wide-ranging set of terms over many health-related categories including Diseases/Health Conditions (containing most terms you will need for this field). When you first click into this field, you may see an \u201codd\u201d value, belonging to a category of NLM MeSH that does not apply to this field. Ignore that. Start typing the health condition of interest, and the drop down list will populate with items based on your inputs. If you are studying a human pain condition or a pain treatment, intervention, or solution, is there a source/causal condition(s) for the pain condition? If so, indicate it here (e.g. A study investigating mechanism of, or risk for, disabling chronic pain in fibromyalgia patients would select \u201cfibromyalgia\u201d; A study measuring incidence and intensity of pain following back surgery would select \u201csurgery\u201d and/or \u201cfailed back surgery syndrome\"). NLM MeSH allows you to be general (e.g. \u201cchronic disease,\" \u201cmultiple chronic conditions\u201d) and/or specific (e.g. \u201cend stage liver disease,\" \u201costeoarthritis, knee\u201d). Use this range of specificity to add all applicable terms. How this field will be used The values from this field will likely be available as 1) an \u201cAdvanced Search\u201d filter on the HEAL Platform Discovery page (depending on the range of answers, a simple filter may not be useful, but we may implement an auto-complete to make a long filter list tenable and retain utility), allowing users to quickly filter to broad, relevant studies, study data, or study-generated knowledge, and/or 2) accessible to free text search and discovery tools that leverage elastic and semantic search, so users can find your study with exact or close/related terms. For example: A clinician who treats fibromyalgia patients seeks research/data on better ways to address fibromyalgia-associated pain, increasing the functional status of patients (filter on Causal condition: \u201cfibromyalgia\u201d ; Target condition: \u201cpain,\" \u201cchronic pain\u201d ; Outcome condition: \u201cphysical function\u201d ).

A patient with end stage renal disease (ESRD), and associated pain, seeks research on treatment development to reduce ESRD pain and pain- associated sleep deprivation (filter on Causal condition: \u201cend stage renal disease\u201d or \u201cchronic kidney disease\u201d ; Target condition: \u201cpain,\" \u201cchronic pain\u201d ; Outcome condition: \u201cpain,\" \u201cchronic pain,\" \u201csleep deprivation\u201d ). A mayor with crisis rates of opioid overdose deaths seeks interventions to reduce immediate catastrophic harms in their town as soon as possible (filter on Causal condition: Not applicable (non-pain condition focus) ; Target condition: \u201copiate overdose\u201d ; Outcome condition: \u201cdeath\u201d ). Pain - Study treatment or target condition is causal condition or pain? How to answer This field only applies to your study if you selected \"Pain\" and/or a modifier of \"Pain\" (e.g. \"Pain, chronic\") for the Relevant Opioid use and/or Pain condition - Category(ies) field in this form section (above) AND you selected a causal condition of pain in the Pain - Causal Condition field in this form section (above) .

When you first click into this field, you may see some \"odd\" looking values that belong to a category of the NLM MeSH that does not apply well to this field. If you start typing in the health condition you are looking for (e.g. start typing in the first letters of the health condition \"fibromyalgia\"), the drop down list will populate with items that start with the typed in letters and you should be able to find your condition of interest. Please consider: For condition-focused studies, what is the condition the study is focused on observing, understanding, or otherwise investigating; For studies focused on treatment of a condition, what is the condition that is the target of treatment in your study. For studies focused on a pain condition, if you indicated a causal condition of pain (e.g. fibromyalgia, end stage renal disease, surgical procedure, lower back injury) above, and you indicated that the causal condition of pain is the target condition of your study (above), please add your causal condition of pain here as your study's 'Target condition'; If you indicated that pain resulting from or associated with the causal condition is the target condition of your study (above), please add 'Pain' (or a more specific modifier(s) of 'Pain', e.g. 'chronic pain', 'idiopathic pain', 'back pain') here as your study's 'Target condition'. NLM MeSH allows you to be quite general (e.g. \"chronic disease\", \"multiple chronic conditions\") and/or quite specific (e.g. \"end stage liver disease\", \"osteoarthritis, knee\").

Relevant Opioid use and/or Pain condition - Category(ies) How to answer This field allows multiple selections, included in the full metadata model definitions . Select all that apply. Regardless of study type, HEAL studies pertain to understanding more about human pain or opioid related conditions and/or related treatments, interventions, or solutions. Which human pain or opioid related condition(s) does your study contribute to understanding? For example: A pragmatic clinical trial to treat fibromyalgia pain with a combination of physical therapy and electro physiotherapy, would likely select \u201cPain,\" \u201cPain, chronic,\" and \u201cPain, resulting from chronic illness.\u201d A basic biochemistry study to understand the mechanism of fentanyl binding to opioid receptors in the brain and the resulting signaling triggered systems, might choose \u201cOpioid overdose\u201d and/or \u201cOpioid use and opioid use disorder.\u201d How this field will be used These values will likely be filterable under \u201cAdvanced Search\u201d on the HEAL Platform Discovery page, and will allow users to quickly find broad, relevant studies, study data, or study-generated knowledge. For example: Opioid Exposure: A pre-K/K school teacher knows their surrounding community has high rates of OUD and wonders if student behavioral issues can be attributed to in utero opioid exposure. They also want to recognize exposure impacts and support intervention for students and their parents. Opioid use and opioid use disorder, relapse; Opioid use and opioid use disorder, chronic: A family member or case manager of a person at high risk of relapse and taking medication for chronic OUD, wants to identify appropriate OUD treatment(s), and learn about geographic and other factors impacting treatment access. Opioid use and opioid use disorder, relapse: A clinician treating OUD notices a high rate of relapse in patients. They seek research on relapse risk factors, or preventive and therapeutic interventions to target OUD relapse. Pain, acute; Pain, resulting from surgery: A patient scheduled for surgery, whose doctor recommends opioids for acute post-surgical pain, does not want to take opioids due to addiction risks or triggering a relapse (if they have a previous OUD) and seeks research on non-drug or non-opioid treatments to address acute post-surgical pain. Opioid use and/or Pain condition - Investigation Stage or Type How to answer This field allows multiple selections, included in the full metadata model definitions . Select all that apply. For example: Incidence of condition: A national survey about pain experience A study using admin data, healthcare claims, or fire department and ambulance run data to estimate opioid overdose incidences per county in IL Risk (or differential risk) of condition: A study looking for biomarkers of those at higher risk of opioid dependence following short term use for acute post surgical pain A study looking at differential risk, by strata, of sociodemographic factors for pain-related condition development, in circumstances like end stage renal disease or fibromyalgia Mechanism of condition: A natural experiment to investigate biological or social/environmental factors that explain differential risk for pain related condition like end stage renal disease or fibromyalgia, across the strata of sociodemographic factors Impact of condition: A study investigating OUD\u2019s impact on the likelihood of completing a degree, getting a job, starting/maintaining a family or romantic relationship, or securing/maintaining housing A study investigating the impact of a high community OUD rate on community crime levels, economic stability, and social cohesion Public attitudes towards or perception of a condition: A national survey asking for attitudes about 1) employing those with OUD, 2) befriending them, 3) having them marry into the family, 4) allowing them access to public funding for long term medical and social support treatment A study testing efficacy of a community-based communications and education campaign to increase previous OUD sufferers\u2019 employability Treatment of a condition: A study investigating whether providing housing and job training support, to people leaving jail on an opioid use or possession charge, prevents OUD relapse or further involvement in the criminal justice system A phase 3 clinical trial investigating efficacy of a novel non-opioid drug to treat chronic pain A study investigating whether a novel implanted device, providing long-term and slow release of an established MAT drug for OUD, can prevent relapse How this field will be used These values will likely be filterable under \u201cAdvanced Search\u201d on the HEAL Platform Discovery page and will allow users to quickly find broad, relevant studies, study data, or study-generated knowledge. Examples include: A school teacher who knows the local community has high OUD rates and: Impact of condition: wonders if student behavioral issues may be attributed in utero exposure to opioids and Treatment of condition: how to recognize exposure impacts, to provide support and intervention for students and parents, while Public attitudes towards or perception of a condition: learning about how/how much opioid use stigma should weigh into an offer to help, as it may expose them to further stigma-related harm A clinician treating OUD patients notices a high rate of patient relapse, who Risk for condition; Differential risk for condition: seeks research on relapse risk factors or Treatment of condition: on preventive or therapeutic interventions that target OUD relapse A patient scheduled for surgery, whose doctor recommended opioids for acute post-surgical pain but Risk for condition; Differential risk for condition: does not want to take opioids because they worry about opioid addiction, or (with a previous OUD) triggering a relapse, and wants to find research on clear risk factors for these outcomes, and/or Incidence of condition; Differential risk for Condition: rates for these negative outcomes is in the general population or populations with known risk factors Pain - Causal condition ( Alias: Causal Condition ) How to answer This field ONLY APPLIES to your study if you selected \u201cPain\u201d and/or a modifier of \u201cPain\u201d (e.g. \u201cPain, chronic\u201d) for the \u201cRelevant Opioid use and/or Pain condition\u201d category(ies) above. This field allows multiple selections. Select all that apply. This field is an array. The controlled vocabulary/pick-list is the NLM MeSH (National Library of Medicine Medical Subject Headings \u2013 see the tree view of this vocabulary here ), which covers a wide-ranging set of terms over many health-related categories including Diseases/Health Conditions (containing most terms you will need for this field). When you first click into this field, you may see an \u201codd\u201d value, belonging to a category of NLM MeSH that does not apply to this field. Ignore that. Start typing the health condition of interest, and the drop down list will populate with items based on your inputs. If you are studying a human pain condition or a pain treatment, intervention, or solution, is there a source/causal condition(s) for the pain condition? If so, indicate it here (e.g. A study investigating mechanism of, or risk for, disabling chronic pain in fibromyalgia patients would select \u201cfibromyalgia\u201d; A study measuring incidence and intensity of pain following back surgery would select \u201csurgery\u201d and/or \u201cfailed back surgery syndrome\"). NLM MeSH allows you to be general (e.g. \u201cchronic disease,\" \u201cmultiple chronic conditions\u201d) and/or specific (e.g. \u201cend stage liver disease,\" \u201costeoarthritis, knee\u201d). Use this range of specificity to add all applicable terms. How this field will be used The values from this field will likely be available as 1) an \u201cAdvanced Search\u201d filter on the HEAL Platform Discovery page (depending on the range of answers, a simple filter may not be useful, but we may implement an auto-complete to make a long filter list tenable and retain utility), allowing users to quickly filter to broad, relevant studies, study data, or study-generated knowledge, and/or 2) accessible to free text search and discovery tools that leverage elastic and semantic search, so users can find your study with exact or close/related terms. For example: A clinician who treats fibromyalgia patients seeks research/data on better ways to address fibromyalgia-associated pain, increasing the functional status of patients (filter on Causal condition: \u201cfibromyalgia\u201d ; Target condition: \u201cpain,\" \u201cchronic pain\u201d ; Outcome condition: \u201cphysical function\u201d ).

Individuals may include: Target discovery: A pharmacology scientist, with capacity to do high throughput screens for drug library impacts on a target of interest, wants to be up on the research and discovery of novel targets for pain or opioid use treatment to begin designing a screen to figure out how to drug those targets. A local public health official or politician seeks to implement policies or resources to address opioid use relapse in their community and wants to see if specific social or mental/behavioral determinants have been identified as good targets for relapse prevention. Target mechanism: A pain researcher, researching the target mechanism for a biomolecule, wants to learn from other potential research on the mechanism, or understand assays to adopt in their own target mechanism research. A pharmacology scientist\u2019s preliminary research to drug one target failed, due to unacceptable toxicity, and they want to learn more about the original biomolecule target mechanism to see if there is another possible biomolecule in the original target mechanism pathway that they can attempt to drug instead, with acceptable toxicity levels. Treatment discovery: An OUD sufferer is allergic to methadone and has trouble remembering to take buprenorphine to stay in remission, so their family member seeks research on developmental new treatments for OUD that might work better. A clinician treating pain or OUD patients wants to understand recent treatment research, so they can ensure patients access the best treatment in a timely manner. Treatment mechanism: A pain or OUD patient\u2019s doctor prescribed a new medication, and they are curious how it works. A clinician wants to keep up to date on research about the treatments they prescribe, to understand who a treatment may work best for or whether there might be contraindications (due to drug interactions, etc.). A pharmacology researcher wants to learn how a drug works to consider developing new drugs, or formulations of the same drug, that may increase efficacy and/or decrease side-effects. Treatment efficacy: A pain or opioid use patient heard about a novel treatment for their condition and wants to find studies on the treatment\u2019s efficacy or even differential efficacy, to determine if it might be effective/ineffective for them. A researcher is trying to collate all evidence available on a specific treatment/intervention efficacy for a meta-analysis. Treatment implementation: A clinician or administrator at a clinic or jail wants to implement a specific intervention protocol for opioid overdose prevention at their facility and seeks information about protocol implementation best practices. Treatment availability or accessibility: A pain or opioid use patient and wants to find nearby treatment facilities that offer a specific type of treatment (e.g. MAT with buprenorphine). A researcher wants to understand the impact of treatment/intervention accessibility on uptake, efficacy of the treatment, and how to use the relative availability or non-availability of a treatment, across locations, to design a natural experiment examining the efficacy.

They may focus on the individual or community, covering the very early/discovery stage of targets or mechanisms to impact those targets, efficacy of a mechanism to impact a target, and implementation. Other studies or data collection efforts may focus on understanding the access or availability of treatments, interventions, or solutions (e.g. SAMHSA N-SSATS and N-MHSS datasets). * HEAL Platform users will look for studies, study data, and study-generated knowledge from a condition- or treatment-focused perspective. * Metadata in this section (including identification of your study as either Condition- or Treatment-focused) allows Platform users to quickly find broad, relevant studies, study data, or study-generated knowledge. * HEAL studies that are NOT Condition- or Treatment-focused (e.g. career development, increasing diversity, developing general study recruitment or consenting procedures, etc.), may skip this section.

Human subjects study examples: Condition-focused: an observational prospective cohort study, following developmental markers in babies exposed to opioids in utero, from birth through adolescence Treatment-focused: a randomized control trial, testing efficacy of a novel non-opioid drug for pain versus status quo use of an opioid drug. Basic science or non-human subjects study examples: Condition-focused: a biochemical study investigating the molecular mechanisms of cell signaling in pain/nociception Treatment-focused: a small molecule screen to discover chemical drugs that activate or deactivate a molecular target involved in opioid-addictive or overdose pathways. How this field will be used These values will likely be filterable under \u201cAdvanced Search\u201d on the HEAL Platform Discovery page. As noted above, a wide variety of Platform users will likely seek condition- or treatment-focused studies, study data, and study-generated knowledge, allowing them to better study and/or understand 1) a human opioid or pain condition and/or 2) opioid or pain treatments, interventions, or solutions at the individual or community level. Identification of your study as either Condition- or Treatment-focused, allows these users to more rapidly filter studies and discover the information they need. Types of Determinants/Mechanisms the study is investigating How to answer This field allows multiple selections from a limited set of answers, including: Biology and Health Mental Health Social Determinants Public Attitudes or Stigma Stigma Select all that applu. For Condition-focused studies, consider the determinants or mechanisms of the human opioid or pain condition you are investigating.

They may focus on the individual or community, covering the very early/discovery stage of targets or mechanisms to impact those targets, efficacy of a mechanism to impact a target, and implementation. Other studies or data collection efforts may focus on understanding the access or availability of treatments, interventions, or solutions (e.g. SAMHSA N-SSATS and N-MHSS datasets). * HEAL Platform users will look for studies, study data, and study-generated knowledge from a condition- or treatment-focused perspective. * Metadata in this section (including identification of your study as either Condition- or Treatment-focused) allows Platform users to quickly find broad, relevant studies, study data, or study-generated knowledge. * HEAL studies that are NOT Condition- or Treatment-focused (e.g. career development, increasing diversity, developing general study recruitment or consenting procedures, etc.), may skip this section.

Study Translational Focus How to answer This field allows selection of a single answer from a limited set of choices, including: \u201cCondition\u201d for Condition-focused studies, and \u201cTreatment\u201d for Treatment-focused studies (see above for definitions). Human subjects study examples: Condition-focused: an observational prospective cohort study, following developmental markers in babies exposed to opioids in utero, from birth through adolescence Treatment-focused: a randomized control trial, testing efficacy of a novel non-opioid drug for pain versus status quo use of an opioid drug. Basic science or non-human subjects study examples: Condition-focused: a biochemical study investigating the molecular mechanisms of cell signaling in pain/nociception Treatment-focused: a small molecule screen to discover chemical drugs that activate or deactivate a molecular target involved in opioid-addictive or overdose pathways. How this field will be used These values will likely be filterable under \u201cAdvanced Search\u201d on the HEAL Platform Discovery page. As noted above, a wide variety of Platform users will likely seek condition- or treatment-focused studies, study data, and study-generated knowledge, allowing them to better study and/or understand 1) a human opioid or pain condition and/or 2) opioid or pain treatments, interventions, or solutions at the individual or community level. Identification of your study as either Condition- or Treatment-focused, allows these users to more rapidly filter studies and discover the information they need. Types of Determinants/Mechanisms the study is investigating How to answer This field allows multiple selections from a limited set of answers, including: Biology and Health Mental Health Social Determinants Public Attitudes or Stigma Stigma Select all that applu.
