    <ul>
    <li> I'm a pre-K/K school teacher and I know that the community around my school has high rates of OUD - I wonder if some of the behavioral issues my students have can be attributed to affects of in utero exposure to opioids and if so, how I can recognize these exposure impacts and potentially provide support and intervention to my students and their parents - I'm particularly interested in seeing if there are any <u>narrative case studies</u> authored by either medical or educational providers that describe interactions with and behaviors of young children impacted by in utero exposure to OUD to see if they seem similar to my own experiences (filter on <strong>"Qualitative"</strong>)<br />
    </li>
    <li> I'm a clinician treating OUD patients and I notice that there's a high rate of relapse among my patients - I've seen some news stories and case studies that seem to point towards a potential role for anxiety and depression as risk factors for OUD relapse, and  want to see if there's any research that has collected some quantitative data that could give a better sense for whether anxiety and depression are clearly significant risk factors, and if so, whether these factors increase relapse risk by a clinically meaningful amount (filter on <strong>"Quantitative"</strong>)

    The values from this field will likely be available as browsable text on the study page of a study indexed on the HEAL Platform, and will allow Platform users to quickly get a sense for how large a study is - this may help Platform users to quickly get a sense for the power of a study to detect an effect of an intervention or to reflect observational metrics (e.g. prevalence, incidence, differential risk, etc.) accurately, and for Platform users looking for data to use in a secondary analysis, this may help them to get an aggregate count of observations relevant to their secondary analysis across studies they've found on the HEAL Platform and/or to decide if the count available from a particular study is worth the effort of requesting access to the study data in the case that the data has substantial access restrictions and burdens associated with requesting and obtaining access to the data. <strong>Examples include:</strong>

    The values from this field will likely be available as browsable text on the study page of a study indexed on the HEAL Platform, and will allow Platform users to quickly get a sense for how large a study is - this may help Platform users to quickly get a sense for the power of a study to detect an effect of an intervention or to reflect observational metrics (e.g. prevalence, incidence, differential risk, etc.) accurately, and for Platform users looking for data to use in a secondary analysis, this may help them to get an aggregate count of observations relevant to their secondary analysis across studies they've found on the HEAL Platform and/or to decide if the count available from a particular study is worth the effort of requesting access to the study data in the case that the data has substantial access restrictions and burdens associated with requesting and obtaining access to the data. <strong>Examples include:</strong> 
    <ul>
    <li> I'm a researcher looking for studies for a meta-analysis of studies that have looked at the impact of housing insecurity on OUD outcomes following completion of residential OUD treatment program, and I want to limit the studies in my meta-analysis to those that collected indidividual level data, including high-resolution geographic data for individuals, because I want to combine individual level data for my meta-analysis and I want to correct for individual-level socio-enviornmental factors that can be gleaned from high-resolution geographic data in my analysis - Because high-resolution geographic information associated with individual-level data represents a substantial re-identification/disclosure risk, I know that any study that makes this data available will do so with significant access restrictions and I will need to do a fair amount of work to get access to each data set - Because of this, I want to look at 1) how many individuals data is available for in each study, AND 2) assess the degree to which underlying structures in the individual level data (e.g. high correlations within subsets of the individual) reduce the actual number of individuals to a lower effective number of individuals, and limit myself to studies that have data for at least 50 individuals, OR at least 5 clusters of 30 individuals each (once I've filtered down to the set of studies that meet most of my criteria, <strong>review the study page of each study and manually filter out studies that have 1) an expected number of the unit of collection under 50 OR 2) an expected number of unit of analysis under 5</strong>)

    <mark>This field only applies to your study if you answered "Human" to the Study subject type question in the <a href="../study-type/">Study Type</a> form section AND "Yes" to the Will your study collect or produce data question in the <a href="../data-availability/">Data Availability</a> form section</mark>. This field allows selection of multiple answers from a limited set of possible answers.

Please select all that apply. <u>Please consider:</u> For studies with human subjects that will make at least some data available, will data be made available at the individual subject level or some level of aggregation? E.g. A study with opioid overdose rate as the outcome that obtains individually identified healthcare provider and/or claims records covering the study period for each individual within the study to follow and measure this outcome AND will make individual level-data available in a public data repository (select <strong>"Individual - Unaggregated"</strong>); If the same study will ONLY or ALSO make aggregated data available, please select <strong>"Individual - Aggregated"</strong> and any/all options that more specifically describe the type(s) of aggregated data you will make available (e.g. if you will provide population summary statistics please select "Aggregated, across all (population summary statistics)"); A cluster-randomized control trial with randomization at the clinic level that collects data at the individual level for each individual in each cluster/clinic, but analyzes effect of the intervention on the primary outcome at the cluster/clinic level as a way to account for high intra-cluster/clinic correlation, will NOT make data available at the individual level, AND will make data available at the cluster/clinic level in a public data repository (select <strong>"Community, Group, Cluster, Population - Unaggregated"</strong>); If the same study will ONLY or ALSO make data aggregated across cluster/clinics available, please select <strong>"Community, Group, Cluster, Population - Aggregated"</strong> and any/all options that more specifically describe the type(s) of aggregated data you will make available (e.g. if you will provide data aggregated across all clusters broken out by treatment versus control intervention status/assignment please select "Aggregated, by treatment/exposure group")

    </li>
    <li> I'm a journalist without a lot of analytic resources, looking for study summary statistics that I can use to decide if the data is useful to my story and interesting enough to either 1) ask my news outlet to assign analytic staff to securing the underlying data and using it for a more in-depth analysis OR 2) use the summary statistics alone to tell a good story about sociodemographic disparities in access to MOUD (filter on <strong>"Aggregated"</strong>, <strong>"Aggregated, by demographic variable(s)"</strong>, , <strong>"Aggregated, by geographic variable(s)"</strong>)
