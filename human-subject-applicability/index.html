<strong>Example</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>A Platform User wants to find studies that specifically study treatment of pain in <u>women</u>, or prevention of opioid use disorder in <u>adolescents</u> - 
Results could respectively include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>a basic science trial studying the differential impact of an opioid drug on pain/nociception signaling pathways in the presence versus absence of estrogen, and </li>
<li>a school-based cluster randomized control trial in high schools testing impact of a combination opioid use disorder education curriculum and peer counseling intervention on opioid use disorder incidence)</li>

<blockquote>
<p>Here the Platform User from the [Exclusive] condition above could broaden their search to find studies that are not super specific to their population of interest but still may have applicable findings and insights; 
the Platform User may take this approach if, for example, a more specific [Exclusive] search yields few results - 
results could respectively include:</p>
<blockquote>
<ul>
<li>a basic science trial studying the impact of an opioid drug on pain/nociception signaling pathways in a mouse model of lower back injury where both male and female mice are included in the experiments, and </li>
<li>a community-based cluster randomized control trial testing impact of a community-wide postering/flyering communications campaign intervention on opioid use disorder incidence)    </li>

    >> * a basic science study using biochemistry experiments to investigate potential molecular interactions between puberty-blocking drugs and opioid receptor pathways, and using animal model experiments to investigate the impact of co-administration of puberty-blocking drugs and opioids in an adolescent mouse injury pain model on opioid-induced pain-relief and on risk of opioid addiction &rarr; **this study may choose 'Transgender man/trans man/female-to-male (FTM)', ‘Transgender woman/trans woman/male-to-female (MTF)’, and 'Genderqueer/gender nonconforming/neither exclusively male nor female'** (puberty blockers can be prescribed to early-adolescents who consider their gender identity to be trans OR non-binary; non-binary would be covered under the Genderqueer category)    
    * a clinical trial investigating the efficacy of adding a physical therapy and swim exercise therapy regimen to short-course opioids to prevent transition of acute post-surgical pain to chronic pain in cisgender women and transgender men following surgical mastectomy &rarr; **this study may choose 'Female' and 'Transgender man/trans man/female-to-male (FTM)**

    > Example use cases where a Platform User is looking for studies with **clear special applicability** include:

    >> * I am a program manager for a community-based after-school sports program for adolescents that is specifically welcoming to adolescents across the gender-identity spectrum - I know that risk of opioid exposure and addiction once exposed differ and tend to be higher for individuals in a gender identity minority as compared to individuals in a gender identity majority (i.e. cis male or cis female) - I am looking for studies that specifically investigate prevention of opioid use disorder in gender-identity minority adolescents, either in general, or specifically following treatment for pain due to a sports injury. To find such studies, I would filter on the gender identity field, choosing all of the gender identity minority options (i.e. **‘Transgender man/trans man/female-to-male (FTM)’, ‘Transgender woman/trans woman/male-to-female (MTF)’, ‘Genderqueer/gender nonconforming/neither exclusively male nor female’, ‘Other’**) or the subset of gender identity minority options I am most interested in (e.g. If several of the program participants are trans boys and I am particularly focused on that group I might just choose **'Transgender man/trans man/female-to-male (FTM)'**)  
    * I am a clinician that treats trans patients with hormone therapy and gender affirming surgical care - Some of my patients come to me while on meds for maintenance of opioid use disorder remission, or start on these meds while in my care - I am looking for studies that specifically investigate risk factors and mechanisms to address risk for opioid use disorder relapse in trans patients. To find such studies, I would filter on the gender identity field, choosing **‘Transgender man/trans man/female-to-male (FTM)’** and **‘Transgender woman/trans woman/male-to-female (MTF)’**    
        * If I don't find many studies of interest when using these limiting gender identity filters, I may want to expand my search to look for all studies that **may apply** to my population of interest because they are conducted either without regard to gender identity or are conducted in a manner that is inclusive of the full range of gender identities. 
        * To find such studies, I would filter on the gender identity field and choose the **'Conducted without regard to gender identity'** and/or **'Inclusive of all gender identities'** value options. 
        * This filter setting will return studies that indicated their study was conducted without regard to gender identity or inclusive of all gender identities by selecting NONE of the gender identity value options

<blockquote>
<p>The values from this field will be accessible to browse on the study's HEAL Data Platform study page and will give Platform users who find the study a sense for how generalizable the study may be. For example, if a community based trial of an intervention for OUD shows great results but it was tested in NYC and I'm looking for an intervention that will work in a small town in the midwest, I may want to really consider if/how the results will translate across contexts.</p>
<p>These values may also provide information that will aid a Platform user looking to perform a meta-analysis of study results to synthesize across and provide more generalizable conclustions or to create a synthetic cohort across similar studies consisting of enrolled human subjects in different geographic locations again, at least in part, to provide answers to similar questions as the originating studies but with more generalizability</p>
<p>These values may also provide information that will aid a Platform user looking to ask research questions about how state level policies or other state-level environmental factors may play a role/impact results of a specific study interventions approach (e.g. an intervention that provides connection to a social worker to individuals with history of OUD upon exit from prison may be very effective in a state that 1) has a strong educational infrastructure to train social workers, 2) provides loan forgiveness or other financial supports/incentives to social workers, 3) has policies in place to fully fund community health centers that have providers licensed to prescribe buprenorphine, etc. - the same intervention may be totally ineffective in a state where these conditions do not exist, perhaps making social workers scarce, overloaded, and unable to find resources for their clients) </p>
