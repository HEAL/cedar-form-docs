Will the study make data available? None/Some/All How to answer This field ONLY APPLIES if you answered \u201cYes\u201d to \u201cWill the study collect or produce data?\u201d Answers include: None : If you do not plan to make any study data available in a HEAL approved repository, select \u201cNone.\u201d While most HEAL studies are obligated to share data, select HEAL studies, such as SBIR grants, are not. Some : If you plan to make some, but not all, study data available, select \u201cSome.\u201d For example, you may plan to share data needed to reproduce publications, processed data files, or extensively de-identified data, but exclude certain datasets or sources (such as administrative data, when your data sharing agreement does not allow sharing). All : If you plan to make study data available to the greatest extent possible (e.g. sharing nearly raw clinical trial data in a data repository, subject to very strong access controls, including some data that may be very useful for analysis but pose a risk of re-identification, such as highly granular geographic information, detailed diagnostic and care provision, utilization patterns, and/or clinician notes), select \u201cAll.\u201d How this field will be used This field will allow users to filter between studies that will share data, and those that will not. Users who are interested in accessing datasets that include highly sensitive variables that present re-identification risks (e.g. geographic variables with high granularity) may want to filter down to studies that plan to share \u201cAll\u201d data, as this will filter out studies that plan to share only extensively de-identified data.

Some : If some of your repository-hosted study data will be open access or minimally restricted, while other data will be available only after a request and approval process that does require substantial manual intervention (e.g. submission of a project proposal and IRB approval by the requestor; review by a Data Access Committee on the repository end; etc.). For example, a clinical trial may choose this option when sharing 1) an extensively de-identified dataset that is open access/minimal access controls, AND 2) a less de-identified dataset, shared under strict access controls, that includes features which add value for some analysis questions but also present substantial risk for re-identification. All : If all your repository-hosted study data will be available only following a request and approval process requiring substantial manual intervention (e.g. submission of a project proposal and IRB approval by the requestor; review by a Data Access Committee on the repository end; etc.). For example, a clinical trial may choose this option when ONLY sharing a less de-identified dataset that includes features which add value for some analysis questions, but also present substantial risk for re-identification, shared under strict access controls. These studies WILL NOT share a extensively de-identified version of the data as open access/minimal access controls.

None/Some/All How to answer This field ONLY APPLIES if you answered \u201cYes\u201d to \u201cWill the study collect or produce data?\u201d AND you answered \u201cSome\u201d or \u201cAll\u201d to \u201cWill the study make data available?\u201d Answers include None : If all your repository-hosted study data will be open access or minimally restricted (i.e. available after signing a minimal DUA that does not require any manual intervention or approval). Some : If some of your repository-hosted study data will be open access or minimally restricted, while other data will be available only after a request and approval process that does require substantial manual intervention (e.g. submission of a project proposal and IRB approval by the requestor; review by a Data Access Committee on the repository end; etc.). For example, a clinical trial may choose this option when sharing 1) an extensively de-identified dataset that is open access/minimal access controls, AND 2) a less de-identified dataset, shared under strict access controls, that includes features which add value for some analysis questions but also present substantial risk for re-identification. All : If all your repository-hosted study data will be available only following a request and approval process requiring substantial manual intervention (e.g. submission of a project proposal and IRB approval by the requestor; review by a Data Access Committee on the repository end; etc.). For example, a clinical trial may choose this option when ONLY sharing a less de-identified dataset that includes features which add value for some analysis questions, but also present substantial risk for re-identification, shared under strict access controls. These studies WILL NOT share a extensively de-identified version of the data as open access/minimal access controls. How this field will be used This field will allow users looking for data they may be able to access quickly and easily to filter for studies sharing some, or all, of their data as open access/minimal access controls.

These values will likely be filterable under \u201cAdvanced Search\u201d on the HEAL Platform Discovery page, allowing users to quickly find broad, relevant studies, study data, or study-generated knowledge. For example: Qualitative: A pre-K/K school teacher knows their surrounding community has high rates of OUD and wonders if student behavioral issues can be attributed to in utero opioid exposure. They want to recognize exposure impacts and support intervention for students and their parents, while also finding narrative case studies, by medical or educational providers, describing interactions with, and behaviors of, young children impacted by in utero OUD exposure, to understand similarities in experiences. Quantitative: A clinician treating OUD notices a high rate of relapse in patients. They have seen news stories and case studies suggesting OUD relapse risks related to anxiety and depression, and seek quantitative research data to better understand whether anxiety and depression are clear risk factors, and if so, whether these factors increase relapse risk by a clinically meaningful amount.

For example: Questionnaire/Survey/Assessment - validated instrument: A researcher seeks studies to conduct a meta-analysis of studies looking at the impact of housing insecurity on OUD outcomes following completion of residential OUD treatment programs. They want to limit the studies to those that used a validated tool to measure housing status/insecurity. Human Subject Data - Unit of Collection How to answer This field ONLY APPLIES studies that answered \u201cHuman\u201d for study subject type in the Study Type section AND \u201cYes\u201d to \u201cWill your study collect or produce data?\u201d in the Data Availability section. This field allows multiple selections, included in the full metadata model definitions. Select all that apply. For studies with human subjects, is the data collected at the individual or population level? For example: Individual : A study with opioid overdose rate outcomes, following and measuring outcomes by obtaining individually identified healthcare provider and/or claims records for individuals during the study period. Population: A study with opioid overdose rate outcomes, obtaining community counts of opioid overdose by measuring outcomes following a community-level intervention, while dividing the overdose counts by the total of relevant individuals. How this field will be used These values will likely be filterable under \u201cAdvanced Search\u201d on the HEAL Platform Discovery page, allowing users to quickly find broad, relevant studies, study data, or study-generated knowledge. For example: Individual: A researcher seeks studies to conduct a meta-analysis of studies looking at the impact of housing insecurity on OUD outcomes, following completion of residential OUD treatment programs. They want to limit studies to those collecting individual-level data, including high-resolution individual geographic data, so they can combine individual-level data, and will also correct for individual socio-environmental factors. Human Subject Data - Expected Number of the Unit of Collection How to answer This field ONLY APPLIES if you answered \u201cHuman\u201d to study subject type in the Study Type section AND \u201cYes\u201d to \u201cWill your study collect or produce data?\u201d in the Data Availability section. This field allows integer entries. For studies with human subjects, on how many subjects do you plan to collect data? If the data collection unit is individuals, this is the expected number of individuals. If the data collection unit is populations/clusters, this is the expected number of populations/clusters. For example: For a study with opioid overdose rate outcomes, following and measuring outcomes by obtaining individually identified healthcare provider and/or claims records for individuals during the study period, select the number of individuals enrolled in the study. For a study with opioid overdose rate outcomes, obtaining community counts of opioid overdose by measuring outcomes following a community-level intervention, while dividing the overdose counts by the total of relevant individuals, select the number of communities enrolled in the study. How this field will be used These values will likely be available, as text, on the HEAL study page, allowing users to quickly view how large a study is and decide how much power it has to detect an intervention's effect or to reflect observational metrics (e.g., prevalence, incidence, differential risk, etc.) accurately. For users seeking data to use in a secondary analysis, this may help get an aggregate count of relevant observations across studies on the HEAL Platform and/or to decide if a particular study is worth the effort to request study data access, if the data has substantial access restrictions and burdens. For example: A researcher conducting a meta-analysis of studies on housing insecurity impacts on OUD outcomes, following residential OUD treatment, will limit studies to those collecting individual data, including high-resolution geographic data, to combine this data and correct for socio-environmental factors. Since high-resolution individual geographic information represents a substantial re-identification/disclosure risk, these studies will have significant access restrictions, requiring extensive work to gain access, so they will view the number of individuals in each study and limit themselves to studies with data for at least 50 individuals. After finding studies that meet most criteria, they can review each study page and manually filter out studies that expect fewer than 50 participants.

This field allows multiple selections, included in the full metadata model definitions. Select all that apply. For studies with human subjects, is the data analyzed at the individual or population level? If you selected ONLY \u201cPopulation\u201d for the Unit of collection (above), select ONLY \u201cPopulation\u201d here. For example: A randomized control trial of subjects (randomized at the individual level) across multiple clinics, collects data on each participant and analyzes intervention effects on the primary outcome, at the individual level, using a random-effects model to correct for intra-clinic/class correlation (Unit of collection: Individual; unit of analysis: Individual). A cluster-randomized control trial (randomized at the clinic level) collects data at the individual level for each cluster/clinic but analyzes effect of the intervention on the primary outcome at the cluster/clinic level as to account for high intra-cluster/clinic correlation (Unit of collection: Individual; unit of analysis: Population) How this field will be used These values will likely be filterable under \u201cAdvanced Search\u201d on the HEAL Platform Discovery page, allowing users to quickly find broad, relevant studies, study data, or study-generated knowledge. They will also be easily accessible to viewers, as text, on the study page. Examples include: Population : An educator seeking evidence on school-based interventions to prevent first opioid use in high school students to support a proposal (for their principal) requesting implementation funds and resources wants studies that are statistically sound and correct for the high intra-class correlation, generally found within schools and even classrooms, by analyzing the data grouped at one/both levels. Individual: A researcher seeks individual data to include in a secondary analysis, and wants to know if it may be available from a particular study with a clear structure (e.g. correlations within subsets of the individuals) they will need to account for in their own analysis.

Since high-resolution individual geographic information represents a substantial re-identification/disclosure risk, these studies will have significant access restrictions, requiring extensive work to gain access. Because of this, they will determine: 1) How many individuals\u2019 data is available in each study and 2) The degree to which underlying structures in the individual data (e.g. high correlations within individual subsets) effectively reduce this number. They will limit themself to studies with data for at least 50 individuals 5 clusters of 30 individuals. After finding studies that meet most criteria, they can review each study\u2019s page and manually filter out studies with: 1) Fewer than 50 units of collection OR 2) Fewer than 5 units of analysis.

For example: Individual - Unaggregated: A researcher conducting a meta-analysis of studies on housing insecurity impacts on OUD outcomes, following residential OUD treatment wants to limit studies to those that collected individual-level data and will make it available in a public data repository at the individual level, because they want to combine individual data. Aggregated; Aggregated, by demographic variable(s); OR Aggregated, by geographic variable(s): A journalist without many analytic resources seeks study summary statistics to decide if the data is useful to a story and interesting enough to either: 1) Ask their news outlet to assign analytics staff to secure underlying data for a more in-depth analysis, OR 2) Use the summary statistics alone to tell a good story about sociodemographic disparities in access to MOUD Human Subject Geographic Data - Collected at what level of detail?

For example: Qualitative: A pre-K/K school teacher knows their surrounding community has high rates of OUD and wonders if student behavioral issues can be attributed to in utero opioid exposure. They want to recognize exposure impacts and support intervention for students and their parents, while also finding narrative case studies, by medical or educational providers, describing interactions with, and behaviors of, young children impacted by in utero OUD exposure, to understand similarities in experiences. Quantitative: A clinician treating OUD notices a high rate of relapse in patients. They have seen news stories and case studies suggesting OUD relapse risks related to anxiety and depression, and seek quantitative research data to better understand whether anxiety and depression are clear risk factors, and if so, whether these factors increase relapse risk by a clinically meaningful amount.

For example: Questionnaire/Survey/Assessment - validated instrument: A researcher seeks studies to conduct a meta-analysis of studies looking at the impact of housing insecurity on OUD outcomes following completion of residential OUD treatment programs. They want to limit the studies to those that used a validated tool to measure housing status/insecurity.

This field allows multiple selections, included in the full metadata model definitions. Select all that apply. For studies with human subjects, is the data collected at the individual or population level? For example: Individual : A study with opioid overdose rate outcomes, following and measuring outcomes by obtaining individually identified healthcare provider and/or claims records for individuals during the study period. Population: A study with opioid overdose rate outcomes, obtaining community counts of opioid overdose by measuring outcomes following a community-level intervention, while dividing the overdose counts by the total of relevant individuals. How this field will be used These values will likely be filterable under \u201cAdvanced Search\u201d on the HEAL Platform Discovery page, allowing users to quickly find broad, relevant studies, study data, or study-generated knowledge. For example: Individual: A researcher seeks studies to conduct a meta-analysis of studies looking at the impact of housing insecurity on OUD outcomes, following completion of residential OUD treatment programs. They want to limit studies to those collecting individual-level data, including high-resolution individual geographic data, so they can combine individual-level data, and will also correct for individual socio-environmental factors.

This field allows integer entries. For studies with human subjects, on how many subjects do you plan to collect data? If the data collection unit is individuals, this is the expected number of individuals. If the data collection unit is populations/clusters, this is the expected number of populations/clusters. For example: For a study with opioid overdose rate outcomes, following and measuring outcomes by obtaining individually identified healthcare provider and/or claims records for individuals during the study period, select the number of individuals enrolled in the study. For a study with opioid overdose rate outcomes, obtaining community counts of opioid overdose by measuring outcomes following a community-level intervention, while dividing the overdose counts by the total of relevant individuals, select the number of communities enrolled in the study. How this field will be used These values will likely be available, as text, on the HEAL study page, allowing users to quickly view how large a study is and decide how much power it has to detect an intervention's effect or to reflect observational metrics (e.g., prevalence, incidence, differential risk, etc.) accurately. For users seeking data to use in a secondary analysis, this may help get an aggregate count of relevant observations across studies on the HEAL Platform and/or to decide if a particular study is worth the effort to request study data access, if the data has substantial access restrictions and burdens. For example: A researcher conducting a meta-analysis of studies on housing insecurity impacts on OUD outcomes, following residential OUD treatment, will limit studies to those collecting individual data, including high-resolution geographic data, to combine this data and correct for socio-environmental factors. Since high-resolution individual geographic information represents a substantial re-identification/disclosure risk, these studies will have significant access restrictions, requiring extensive work to gain access, so they will view the number of individuals in each study and limit themselves to studies with data for at least 50 individuals. After finding studies that meet most criteria, they can review each study page and manually filter out studies that expect fewer than 50 participants.

For studies with human subjects, is the data analyzed at the individual or population level? If you selected ONLY \u201cPopulation\u201d for the Unit of collection (above), select ONLY \u201cPopulation\u201d here. For example: A randomized control trial of subjects (randomized at the individual level) across multiple clinics, collects data on each participant and analyzes intervention effects on the primary outcome, at the individual level, using a random-effects model to correct for intra-clinic/class correlation (Unit of collection: Individual; unit of analysis: Individual). A cluster-randomized control trial (randomized at the clinic level) collects data at the individual level for each cluster/clinic but analyzes effect of the intervention on the primary outcome at the cluster/clinic level as to account for high intra-cluster/clinic correlation (Unit of collection: Individual; unit of analysis: Population) How this field will be used These values will likely be filterable under \u201cAdvanced Search\u201d on the HEAL Platform Discovery page, allowing users to quickly find broad, relevant studies, study data, or study-generated knowledge. They will also be easily accessible to viewers, as text, on the study page. Examples include: Population : An educator seeking evidence on school-based interventions to prevent first opioid use in high school students to support a proposal (for their principal) requesting implementation funds and resources wants studies that are statistically sound and correct for the high intra-class correlation, generally found within schools and even classrooms, by analyzing the data grouped at one/both levels. Individual: A researcher seeks individual data to include in a secondary analysis, and wants to know if it may be available from a particular study with a clear structure (e.g. correlations within subsets of the individuals) they will need to account for in their own analysis.

Because of this, they will determine: 1) How many individuals\u2019 data is available in each study and 2) The degree to which underlying structures in the individual data (e.g. high correlations within individual subsets) effectively reduce this number. They will limit themself to studies with data for at least 50 individuals 5 clusters of 30 individuals. After finding studies that meet most criteria, they can review each study\u2019s page and manually filter out studies with: 1) Fewer than 50 units of collection OR 2) Fewer than 5 units of analysis.

For condition studies, what (if any) other causally related conditions is the study measuring, observing, understanding, or otherwise investigating? For treatment studies, what condition and treatment outcomes are being measured? For example: A trial to determine efficacy of modifying ESRD dialysis regimens to reduce pain and mortality, while collecting self-reported baseline (and other) depression and anxiety metrics (Causal condition: \u201cend stage renal disease\u201d; Target condition: end stage renal disease; Outcome condition: \u201cpain,\"\u201cdeath\u201d ; Other condition: \u201cdepression,\"\u201canxiety,\" \u201cmental health\u201d ) A basic science study, using single cell DRG neuron pain stimuli exposures (in cultures), to investigate the timing and mechanistic relationship, at the cellular level, between acute pain signaling and transition to chronic pain signaling signatures, while also measuring neuron inflammatory molecule/ cytokine production status (Causal condition: \u201cpain,\" \u201cacute pain\u201d ; Target condition: \u201cpain,\" \u201cacute pain\u201d ; Outcome condition: \u201cpain,\"\u201cchronic pain\u201d ; Other condition: \u201cinflammation,\"\u201cneurogenic inflammation\u201d ).

Extra context: The HEAL Initiative was founded to reduce deaths and other negative consequences of opioid use disorder (OUD), opioid overdose, and opioid exposure. The HEAL Initiative also focuses on finding new solutions to human pain and pain management (largely because opioid pain treatment has historically been foundational in initiating OUD, and in increasing supply and access to opioid pills for pain patients and the general population). Even when HEAL studies don\u2019t involve human subjects, they generally focus on learning more about a human pain or opioid use condition ( Condition-focused ) or they focus on learning more about a treatment, intervention, or solution for a human pain or opioid use condition ( Treatment-focused ). We expect that many HEAL Platform users will look for studies, study data, and study-generated knowledge from a condition- or treatment-focused perspective; they will either want to find new information about a human pain or opioid use condition, or treatment for a human pain or opioid use condition. Classifying your study in this way (i.e. identifying your study as either Condition- or Treatment-focused) allows Platform users to quickly find the studies, study data, or study-generated knowledge that will get them closer to the information they are looking for.

This section has two fields; click below to expand guidance for each field. Study Translational Focus How to answer This field allows selection of a single answer from a limited set of choices, including: \u201cCondition\u201d for Condition-focused studies, and \u201cTreatment of a condition\u201d for Treatment-focused studies (see above for definitions). Human subjects study examples: Condition-focused: an observational prospective cohort study, following developmental markers in babies exposed to opioids in utero, from birth through adolescence Treatment-focused: a randomized control trial, testing efficacy of a novel non-opioid drug for pain versus status quo use of an opioid drug. Basic science or non-human subjects study examples: Condition-focused: a biochemical study investigating the molecular mechanisms of cell signaling in pain/nociception Treatment-focused: a small molecule screen to discover chemical drugs that activate or deactivate a molecular target involved in opioid-addictive or overdose pathways. How this field will be used These values will likely be filterable under \u201cAdvanced Search\u201d on the HEAL Platform Discovery page. As noted above, a wide variety of Platform users will likely seek condition- or treatment-focused studies, study data, and study-generated knowledge, allowing them to better study and/or understand 1) a human opioid or pain condition and/or 2) opioid or pain treatments, interventions, or solutions at the individual or community level. Identification of your study as either Condition- or Treatment-focused, allows these users to more rapidly filter studies and discover the information they need. Types of Determinants/Mechanisms the study is investigating How to answer This field allows multiple selections from a limited set of answers, including: Biology and Health Mental Health Social Determinants Public Attitudes or Stigma Stigma Select all that apply. For Condition-focused studies, consider the determinants or mechanisms of the human opioid or pain condition you are investigating. For example: Biology and Health : A study focused on molecular or biophysical mechanisms of bodily injury and pain perception Mental Health : An observational study measuring the incidence and timing of onset of rumination and other anxiety or depressive symptoms/states in patients that do or do not transition from acute to chronic pain Social Determinants : A study measuring items such as income and education level, family support, access to healthcare and food, etc. Public Attitudes or Stigma : A study measuring items such as individual perceptions of stigma from friends, family, and employers around their pain experience Public Attitudes or Stigma AND Social Determinants : A study randomly surveying individuals\u2019 attitudes towards those with OUD (public attitudes and stigma are a subset of all social determinants). For Treatment-focused studies, think about the mechanism of the treatment, intervention, or solution you are investigating. For example: Biology and Health : A small molecule screen study looking for drugs that inhibit a novel protein target in the opioid reward pathway as a possible drug candidate to treat OUD, or a study investigating efficacy of a drug or surgical procedure to treat chronic back pain Mental Health : A study investigating relative efficacy of group therapy versus one-on-one therapy to prevent opioid use relapse Biology and Health AND Social Determinants : A study investigating efficacy of providing individuals leaving jail, with a history of opioid use, either 1) MOUD alone or 2) MOUD plus supports such as housing, food, and education/employment assistance Public Attitudes or Stigma : A study investigating efficacy of a community-level communications campaign, discussing OUD as a disease, to change public attitudes and reduce stigma towards sufferers How this field will be used These values will likely be filterable under \u201cAdvanced Search\u201d on the HEAL Platform Discovery page. Platform users can use this field to filter studies based on their treatment mode. For example: Mental Health : A patient with OUD may seek a mental health intervention/treatment, if they are reluctant to use medication or are in a rehabilitation facility that does not allow medication. Biology and Health : A pain clinician, who has historically treated patients with opioids and seen some resulting addictions, may seek information on non-opioid-based pain treatments. Social Determinants : A public health official, in an area with high opioid overdose rates, despite high naloxone availability, might suspect social determinants (e.g. attitudes/stigma, lack of communication/education, lack of transportation to distribution centers, etc.) play a role in low uptake/effective use of naloxone.
